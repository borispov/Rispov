Imagine there's a man surrounded by sheer nothingness in the deserts. Completely hopeless with no direction nor any guidance. Obviously, chances of survival aren't in his favor. Survival instinct can probably only last for so long. What might save the man and pour some hope into his body? A reason to live.

Reason is meaning. That is what gets people through unimaginable catastrophes. Through everything. Without reason, the man is just a lost wanderer in the desert dependant on luck and coincidence whose most likely set to die. On the other hand, a man with hope and reason is strong and determined and is more likely to survive and thrive.

Always. Ask yourself. What is the reason I do that? Why is it important for me to write that piece, or produce that particular video. Why I insist on _not_ giving up on something despite the hard struggle? Really why. There lies your hidden truth, that serial number for the secret vault, the key for your authenticity.

A word on _Authenticity_. It has received a lot of misconceptional treatment by folks who use that term cheaply. It isn't about being bold about your opinions and perceptions. You could fight a war for your opinions, win, and change them right afterward. Therefore, the war wasn't about your opinions in the first place. Authenticity is the gateway for your true self, your core (if you will).

What's worth suffering for? What is it that you're willing to live for?
