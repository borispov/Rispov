Imagine a man surrounded by sheer nothingness in the deserts. Completely hopeless with no direction nor any guidance. The odds of survival aren't in his favor. Survival instinct can probably only last for so long. 
What might save the man? And what might pour some hope into his body?
A reason to live.

Reason is meaning. That is what gets people through unimaginable catastrophes. Without reason, the man is nothing but a lost wanderer in the desert counting on luck and coincidence whose most likely set to die. On the other hand, a man with hope and reason is strong and determined and is more likely to survive and thrive.

Always. Ask yourself. What is the reason I act that way? Why is this important for me to write that piece, or produce that particular video. Why I insist on _not_ giving up on something despite the struggle? Really why. There lies your truth, the key for your authenticity.

A word on _Authenticity_. It has received a lot of had reputation because of folks who use that term cheaply. It isn't about being bold about your opinions and perceptions. You could fight a war for your opinions, win, and change them right afterward. Therefore, the war wasn't about your opinions in the first place. Authenticity is the gateway for your true self, your core.


What's your reason? 
What's within your true self?
What you're willing to live for?
