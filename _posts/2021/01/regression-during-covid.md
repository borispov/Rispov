Child regression is a well-known phenomenon where the child steps back in a developmental stage he had already mastered or moved on from. For example, a 4 year old may fall back to thumb-sucking, as a means for self-soothing, a behavior he left behind since the age of 7 months. This year with covid-19 around, the occurrence of regression is [much more widespread](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200715/pandemic-causing-kids-to-regress-experts-say) and is prolonged more than usual.

My 2.5 year old daughter has given up on her pacifier during the day, long ago, and only asks for it before bed-time at night. During covid, her kindergarten was closed three times. We are currently still in the third lockdown, and she's been home with me for 2.5 weeks. She asks for her pacifier in the mornings, and before bed in the noon, and much earlier in the night. She has also begun to put things in her mouth way more often than before. We are frustrated. We are reluctant to see how she's needing to fallback to old behaviors but that's also part of the reason she needs to rely on old behaviors. If my baseline state of mind is constantly more stressed and anxious than usual, how come my daughter adjustments to her reality surprise me?

Our child's regression is a crystal clear mirror of our own descent. Question is, are we willing to look?

## Adult Regression

But, what about adult regression, are we immune to regression? Of course not. It is not uncommon for adults under a respectable amount of stress to show symptoms of regression. Perhaps, we won't see adults sucking the thumbs as often as children do, but we might see adults returning to old habits of smoking or nail-biting (onychophagy). Amid the uncertainty, other individuals may try to overcome the sense of insecurity that arises from uncertainty by an attempt to increase their sense of control. One may try and take control by the domination of his partner or colleagues. Some people develop symptoms of _[obsessive compulsive disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/ocd/what-is-obsessive-compulsive-disorder)_ (OCD) and overly trying to organize everything in their life to an extent that is harmful to them and/or disturbing to closed ones. Some men and women fall back to more aggressive patterns and we hear more cases of domestic violence and suicide attempts.

Adult regression is far more crucial and isn't emphasized enough and I will make an effort to explain why. I'd like to introduce [Dr. Gabor Maté](https://drgabormate.com/) and his contribution my point of view. Maté draws a direct connection between parental stress and the pathology of the child. He claims and backs up with studies (though I haven't examined the studies he references) that stressful parenthood directly impacts the likelihood of a child developing all kinds of diseases, physiological and psychological. Hence, an adult who's under serious stress and is potentially in regression could be as well just be the main factor for his child's regression. Therefore, it is of superior importance to assist parents as individuals and thus helping the child not falling back too much in their developmental process.

Parents (ourselves included) blame the government for having the kindergartens closed during covid. Whilst true, a danger of ignorance is lurking. We risk overlooking our own ongoing regression. Parents often regret certain behaviors, but unfortunately, it doesn’t end far enough. Most of those occurrences have very little to do with the child’s _actual_ behavior, and more with the underlying stress that builds upon itself over and over and eventually projected by the parent on the child.

The sense of guilt is not merely an unpleasant feeling one has to endure as a punishment. Simply put, a disaster has happened and it was/is in your hands to handle it and improve/balance the situation. In other words, parental guilt could be a sign that one has to dig deeper and take greater responsibility, perhaps exactly in the place it's overlooked.

## Hope

Gladly, there is a solution that requires some courage and an introspective ability. The goal of digging deeper through guilt (or anger, pain, etc.) is to discover the underlying causes of one’s regression to chaos. The general common theme is stress, anxiety, fear of the unknown. Once you get in touch with deeper layers that construct your daily stress, you’ll gain some certainty and power over your self, because you’ll no longer be as unknown to yourself as you were. Much of the frustration is from patterns of behaviors that occur on a regular basis and not from one-time-behavior. We frustrate over the fact we keep doing the same things we always end up regretting. Clearly, it is important to first grasp what’s fueling it.

During all lockdowns, I was with my daughter most days, while my wife could get only one day a week to work from home. The first lockdown was far the worse, it’s a point in time I’ll remember quite vividly for many years. When my daughter would demonstrate a temper-tantrum I’d join her with the adult version of tantrums, freaking the hell out of her and me as a result. Having an insight as to what has really happened inside me that has led me to behave the way I did on several occasions, doesn’t strip the guilt away, not even in the slightest. However, it has helped me to improve and has lessened the frequency of my adult tantrums and when I do snap, I’m much less of a barbarian.

## Crisis Benefits

The current lockdown is the longest and yet, personally, I find it is the easiest of all. How come?

I have enabled much better bonding with my daughter, she trusts me more than ever, and she’s more affectionate to me as a result. During the first part of the day, I organize my work in such a way it is less stressful, I postpone phone calls and emails for noontime when my child is having a nap. That way, when I’m actually with her, I can be **with her.** As a reward for me (for us) she’s much calmer, she’s more able to play on her own because she knows I’m there this time because I really am.

I am convinced I experience a sort of a regression as well despite my awareness of it. My sense of stability and daily routine has suffered, my sleeping schedule has changed, it is much harder for me to get work done. All of those things, in return, help build up pressure and stress, but, that’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make because the current alternative is far more destructive.

Keep working on it, keep getting to know yourself a little bit better, every day.
