Social work is a profession many young people choose to pursue. Unfortunately, partially for wrong reasons. I believe an introspection is required before you go about any commitment that lasts 3+ years. I encourage an examination process of expectations and inner motivations in becoming a social worker or a _helper_ in general.

Simply wanting to help others is something you hear a lot when students are asked the question: why choose Social Work, while it's not untrue, it's too general and not a good enough answer.

You can help people by being a good car mechanic or a good taxi driver. In fact, I once had a client once who became a taxi driver and he was having at least one meaningful conversation each day where he had some impact on somebody's life.  
More often than not, you don't get that in social work. The overhead with paper work, constant communication with other services, caregivers, handling complaints and exceptional events drain most of the energy. Ever heard about those social workers who don't care anymore? It is certainly an exaggeration but again it's not entirely untrue. It's called burnout. The worker isn't emotionally available. The fantasy of saving others rapidly evaporates into a bitter reality full with frustrations masked by professionalism.

Trying to solve one's own traumas is another motivation, however, a rather unconscious one. It takes courage and self awareness understand such thing. Furthermore, there are probably many other potential solutions other than dedicating a significant part of your lifetime to something that has many implications which you may not be ok with. Salary is one of them, depending on where you're located, though.

So why Social Work?

I wasn't as clear as I could have been when I started. I was a bit naive, too. I learned that Social Work is an entirely different world and couldn't be more further from what I had initially imagined.

Most of us wanted to be therapists, I did, too. But today, many of us are set on different paths. Psychology students are in a similar boat. Difference in Social work is that even without M.A, you're still a licensed social worker and can find a job in the field. Psychology students has to pass quite a challenging test and couple of interviews in order to qualify for Clinical Psychology, a very small percentage of students pass. Others, frustrated, chase different careers feeling they've wasted 4 years of their life.

I am a social worker. I didn't think I'd be doing what I do today nor what I did at my previous roles. I have worked with various groups of people. Most of my significant experience comes from treating people with addictions, however, today I am a coordinator of mental health services. I supervise a staff of 20 mentors/instructors who serve 60 clients who struggle with mental illness. Had I choose again, I most definitely would pick a different journey. Not because my work isn't meaningful, but rather for various other reasons that I'd gladly open up about in future posts/videos. I'm an exploratory person, I try different things, social work is one of those things that has an enormous depth for self and professional growth. I'm 4 years in and still exploring.

P.S I am open to questions. Ask me anything you want regarding that.
