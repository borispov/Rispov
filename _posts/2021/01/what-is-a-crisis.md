A question that has bothered me since the beginning of covid-19 spread, is "am I in the middle of a crisis?". It's likely necessary to highlight that I first and foremost mean that individually. It's really a rather simple question, Do I experience the whole thing as a crisis. How traumatic is that, what impact it carries on me, is it transformative in any way?

Pay attention I didn't mention negative or positive transformation because some of the most stressful events one experiences in life are actually positive (marriage).

Often, a crisis is necessary to make room for a change. Simply put, a growth without rupture is impossible. Something has to die symbolically at least while something else presents itself.

Corona has brought lots of innovations. Some people flourish under the circumstances and express high adjustment abilities and make the best out of it.

For me, corona isn't a crisis in the negative sense. It has forced me to open up and let my creativity to come up with various solutions to different problems.
