Today, my first appointment was a supervision meeting with Lisa. Lisa works as a mentor/instructor with four women that suffer from mental illnesses. I have monthly individual supervision sessions with all of my employees. My style of supervision varies from one employee to another and is very much dependant on employee’s needs in each session. Often, we discuss topics outside the scope of the daily job framework, like philosophy, religion, parenting, family, relationships, politics. I believe that most conversations are not accidental and that certain topics are brought up into our space for a reason. My mission is to identify potential connections between concepts we discuss to possible pitfalls, challenges, and successes they may experience with their clients. The goal of supervision, simply put, is to provide the employee with a supportive framework and sufficient guidance to deal with different layers of complexities that manifest in the field.

As a brief background, we share a common ground of being parents and mutual professional respect for each other. Our conversation began as we've talked about the current lockdown and its implications. Then, we discussed smoking and methods on how to quit from a personal perspective. She mentioned how her child has stated that he’d probably starting smoking too when he grows up and how she’s been quite worried about her child. Well, fairly enough. She knows quite well, too, that children of smoking parents have an elevated risk of smoking. Children are **heavily** influenced by parental modeling for better or worse. We have spoken about the advantages of smoking, because clearly, without them nobody would be smoking in the first place.

I'd like to touch briefly on the subject of breaking habits. We have to deconstruct the habit/addiction before we attempt to _really_ break it. First, by listing the advantages and disadvantages of a certain pattern, advantages in particular though. The disadvantage of a certain behavior is often more clear and it’s the reason one considers to get rid of the behavior altogether. It’s like, one knows why he wants to stop over-eating and start exercising, he might not _really_ know, though, why he can’t stop over-eating and can’t stop NOT-exercising. So, the disadvantages are the reasons one has adopted a certain behavior into a habit. It’s vital and necessary to be as honest as possible about this step, hiding a secret motive will eventually obstruct any progress and cause frustration.

Lisa named few benefits she has being a smoker. For one, she has a legitimate justification for taking a break. For example, she says “Mom’s out for a cigarette” to have few moments of silence away from her kids. Nevertheless, it’s not as much as smoking, as it is the need to zone out and recharge. It serves as an escape route in a way. She's also mentioned, "It's not like I can just tell them I need 5-minutes of silence". Lisa doesn't view that statement as a _possible_ thing to say. The cause for this is a potential therapeutic session, but I'd guess it's rooted in early childhood experiences. Afterward, I asked her "Why not just tell them that?". Lisa giggled, it bothered her. She knows it's what she should have done but was unable to. Shortly after, genuine relief was expressed by Lisa as I asked what kind of a message she signals to her children with current behavior, and whether it is aligned with her values, principles, and expectation from them.

Fundamentally, I pointed to her parental anxiety about her children's probability of beginning to smoke and developing unhealthy habits. I also informed her about researches and studies that show an elevated risk of smoking if parents are smokers. Then, I proceeded to think _together_ _with_ her about alternatives. Like, what would happen, Lisa, if you’d tell them you need a couple of minutes alone? Can you imagine that, if so, how it plays out in your mind? I could tell Lisa was working hard processing the issues we brought up. Furthermore, there was a lesson lurking for myself as well. We should act as though our action carries a significant impact on everyone around us.

By practicing a certain behavior we provide legitimacy for our children to practice the same kind of behavior. Reinforcing and modeling healthy behaviors such as civilized and calm expression of needs and feelings, we help our children pick on that. They will learn to talk to us, truly, and we'll enjoy listening to genuine and authentic human beings. They'll learn how to tell us they need to zone out for 10 minutes before taking on a 1-hour of a demanding task. Otherwise, they'd develop unhealthy patterns of **_acting out_** as a way to communicate with us. I assure you, we don't like acting out. It’s our job to educate, and we do that by being _it_ ourselves. Don’t preach to your kids what you’re unable to practice yourself, it’s practically meaningless, you don’t have to perfect at it, but you have to be somewhere at least trying.

  
As I said, we did end up connecting this whole conversation to a woman Lisa works with for the past 6 months. But, as it wasn’t the main subject of this piece I didn’t conclude it. If you’re interested to hear more about mental rehabilitation processes that take place under my supervision and management, I’d be happy to write about it. Let me know.
