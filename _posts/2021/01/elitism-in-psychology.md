In my mind elitism is associated with two things: Chess and French. Though I haven't conducted any thorough research beyond rumors and personal experience, visiting France with my wife validated what we had heard. We met some friendly young men and women who'd rather sacrifice a potentially interesting conversation with a stranger tourist all to preserve French. Besides a few such occurrences, there are many misconceptions based upon a misunderstanding of the local culture, tradition, manners, etc.

Chess is a novelty in my life. My uncle introduced me to the game when I was 6 years old. He was the only one in the family who was interested in Chess, and I was the only one interested in learning. Truth is, I haven't met anyone even remotely interested in Chess for most of my life. Since the beginning of covid, I started playing and studying chess again. Searching for a partner to learn and train with, I stumbled upon various reasons and excuses people don't/won't play chess. A common assumption was that chess requires a (smart) kind of thinking which, of course, they don't have. Basically, a notion that chess is for brilliant minds.

See, it isn't magically and independently born within one's own mind. There are chess players who believe that chess isn't suitable for less-intelligent people. Perhaps, **some** French people refuse to speak English despite being quite fluent and confident speaking it. In return, it creates an aversion among those who come in contact. My friends won't play it for those reasons.

### Okay, what does it have to do with Psychology?

I believe a very similar phenomenon happens in the field of psychology. By psychology, I mean academia, clinical psychologists, mental health practitioners, social workers, etc. Lecturers hold an illusionary prestige about themselves and the status of Ph.D.'s, teaching mostly theories that suit and fall under their own taste of what's good for everyone. I went through years of focusing on a bunch of theorists while others had been neglected without a proper mention. For example, Carl Jung was not even mentioned, nor was Lacan. We cannot really learn about all of them in such a short span, but we can at least be pointed to correct literature to educate ourselves. I was lucky to be exceptionally interested in psychoanalysis to be exploring Jung's literature by myself.

A brief disclaimer, I have sinned myself as I have deployed such an attitude in the past. Dumbing down concepts so the patient "gets it", making it appear as if big brains required to comprehend such terminology, let alone speak it. We pat our egos. That's all.

The mental health rehabilitation paradigm essentially views the client in the center of the rehabilitation program as the main authority and autonomous entity. Thus, the client decides what's best for his needs. The support system's job is to guide, assist, and inform the client. If we have the reasons and evidence to believe the client's actions are against his own favor, we're still not to override him. However, the reality just isn't as clear as the paradigm suggests, the rehab system does not explicitly decide for the client, but it has its unique complicated way. A committee decides what services the client gets based upon his background and his social worker's request. I have seen way too many cases the committee overrule the recommendations and assign different services, only to be changed back to the initially recommended services 6 months or a year later.

### Unpopular Opinion

That being said, I am part of the abovementioned system. I am a minority, I think that perhaps the current systemization is the problem itself. I try to make a small difference with my staff and my clients. Monthly, I have a group meeting with my staff where we discuss important topics. I make effort to transfer knowledge, concepts, and theories and encourage them to make an effort, too. I am constantly surprised by the hunger for knowledge. They're not all brilliant. But, they are just genuinely interested. And most of the time, if they don't get it, it's my fault, I probably wasn't clear enough, I probably could've articulated better. With patients, it's my job to share information that might be valuable for them. I don't have secret weapons.

We ought to make that which is valuable, transferable, accessible.
