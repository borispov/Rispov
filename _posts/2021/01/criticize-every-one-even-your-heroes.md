Seth Godin once said in an interview that you don't need a mentor, you need a bunch of heroes that you can just imitate. I liked that and wanted to adopt the advice. I started this blog with the initial intention to blog every day - like Seth does. I thought about a couple of figures I had been following online for the past few years and came up with a bunch. For the sake of my argument, I'll focus on Jordan Peterson and share a couple of instances where I had to deploy a careful perspective in regards to the way I absorb his wisdom.

### Examples

For one, Jordan has direct advice for couples and relationship problems. He urges couples to treat the relationship like a business they have to maintain by mutual negotiation and careful schedule and planning to make it successful. It resembles the order aspect of life which Jordan often emphasizes in his talks. Interestingly, Jordan advises couples to make sure they engage in at least two sexual activities per week, otherwise, sexual frustration may build up and lead to potential cheating. He recommends thorough planning via mutual negotiation as a method of making sure it won't be easily postponed, ignored, or forgotten.

I must admit, I was rather uncomfortable at first. How decisively and confidently Jordan claims such claims is unsettling, to say the least. However, whenever Jordan has data to back his claims he mentions it, this time he hasn't. In fact, I came across studies that found happy long-term couples engage in sex once a week on average, and there is no evidence that a higher frequency of sex improves the quality of the relationship any further. Everyone's sex drive is different, some couples have sex more often and some couples less, age is also an important factor as younger couples tend to have sex more often.

Next, at one of his lectures on personality Jordan has proudly shared a story about how he helped a patient in his clinical practice as a clinical psychologist. The patient was an adult female who I think was suffering from a severe case of anxiety. Anxiety and stress often cause strong body tension and this patient's shoulders were particularly tight, so much that Jordan experienced this tension projected onto his stomach. At one point, Jordan invited the patient to put her hands on the desk as he started tapping on her back, and then she blasted in tears of joy and relief. Jordan told this story as if he was performing an old school spontaneous physiotherapy trick from the famous (infamous) 101-clinical psychologist book.

It's struck me as odd at first, I am not a clinical psychologist, but it didn't feel right. When I replayed it again, I said: "It is unethical". I believe I am qualified enough to address the issue and discuss the problematic aspect of Jordan's described professional intervention. Without turning it into a several pages long investigation and citing ethics and interventions, let's highlight details that may or may not be important.

Jordan has stated that he had known this patient for a long time and they developed a rather special relationship. Also, the way the story's depicted, it seems like Jordan hasn't described to the patient what he has planned to perform on her. He simply asked her to bend over his desk. I believe he told us they had a special therapeutic relationship to disguise the potentially unethical behavior he performed afterward. By telling that story, he conveys that clinical psychologists are qualified to do such things, perhaps if only they had developed a "special" therapeutic alliance. In my book, it undermines any trust built whatsoever, no matter how special the trust was. There is no mention of the patient's acceptance of such an act other than his compliance.

Despite the fact that the story ends on a successful note. I find it a bit upsetting. I believe no therapist should act this way unless you're some new-age physio-psycho-therapy and have licenses for both psychotherapy and physiotherapy. Even if you'd like to help your patient with physiology, you can find other ways to do so. Exercising rituals outside the scope of your practice and expertise is an unequivocal NO.

### Summary

To set things straight, I deeply respect Jordan Peterson and I have learned a lot thanks to his lectures that he deliberately posted online. I also learned a lot from Seth Godin and others I had not mentioned in this post. However, it is highly important to keep yourself as objective as you possibly can when you listen to your favorite figures. You have to deploy critical thinking no matter whom you listen to, merely memorizing and copying is not a real understatement, there is no insight, there is no value in that.
