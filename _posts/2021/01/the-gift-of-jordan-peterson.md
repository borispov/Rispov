Jordan Peterson is, without doubt, one of the most significant intellectual figures of these days who happens to be alive as well, despite recent severe health struggles that almost led to his death. His lectures are posted on YouTube for all to view and learn and let me tell you that, it's absolute gold. In what is a relatively short period of time I have digested more information than I have acquired in my 3 years of B.S.W, which is a bit saddening, to say the least.

Jordan has posted many series of lectures about Personality, ordered based on paradigms and schools of thought in psychology. Jordan Peterson speaks as if the material is not only valuable but vital and crucial for us to know. He's really able to stimulate intellectual curiosity. For example, two lectures cover Humanistic Psychology, and specifically Carl Rogers. In approximately two hours he lays out fundamental biographical information about the man and his craft and manages to do so with passion, drawing students to want to know more. I, for instance, was delighted and disappointed at the same time, realizing my teachers have drastically failed to ignite the sparkle. Not only that, what I was taught about Carl Rogers didn't cover half of what Jordan touched on.

As a student, I was intrigued by psychoanalytic literature and had to overcome my limited reading capabilities to tackle some of the readings that occupied my interests. Dr. Levine- Keini Noga was my favorite lecturer, she was fascinated by Freud and Winnicott and so I went on to read some of their material. Additionally, she pointed me to read Dr. Yalom's books which were an outside-the-box revelation for me in contrast to some traditional psychoanalytic thought.

What still bothers me though, is that C.G Jung and Jacques Lacan weren't popular names in our college for unknown reasons to me. In fact, I once overheard that Jung's theoretical work is too religious and magical. I even brought up his name in front of one of the Professors who taught us Psychopathology, he politely dismissed Jung claiming he's not very popular nor is he helpful in today's psychotherapeutic frameworks. Too bad.

In my perception, the gift of Jordan Peterson is a rare one. A vast well of knowledge is available for the masses without special prerequisites. The main one being an internet connection. Jordan offers in-depth discussions and lectures on important philosophical and psychological topics. I got interested from a professional standpoint, however, his lectures are accessible for those without prior academic degrees. His rather simplistic overviews of some of the most complex subjects are also the major critique of his work. That being said, I really believe this wealth of information can potentially educate lots of people and even greater than that, encourage introspective work for individuals.

Academics claim Peterson's approach and observations to certain subjects is rather simplistic and doesn't address the whole range of complexity regarding those subjects. Although this criticism has its merits and I agree it has a simplistic-factor to it, I just truly do not think it's necessarily a drawback.

Finally, I intentionally avoid discussions about Jordan's public scandals and influence altogether as it is irrelevant for the purposes of this post. While I have a great deal of respect towards Jordan, I disagree with several points especially regarding some of his clinical approaches with clients and also some of his anti-Marxist paranoia. But, that's a whole another topic for a separate post.
