Lately, a common frustration strikes me especially when I'm having alone-time. Last night while taking a shower, the same typical stream of thoughts has occupied my mind, and a sense of frustration that I must do something to express my unrealized potential. So, I'd go through different existing ideas and mix them up and come up with a couple of new ones, and more often than not they're probably absolute garbage. In the heat of a moment, I’m usually very confident that my idea is an epiphany and that this is it, this is my time to roll. However, time goes by and as I get closer to the stuff that intimidates me, I back off. I back the heck off. But I do so in a such manipulative manner that I’m not even aware I’m backing off, but rather, I’m rationalizing why it’s better not to proceed. See, everyone who dares to be ambitious and has big dreams act that way. Ever heard about the 1% of most successful people? Thing is, most people don’t fall into the 1% and don’t succeed in a grandiose way.

But how to even get any closer success? Usually, those who just do what doesn’t make them miserable and if they happen to enjoy it then they have an advantage. There is a countless number of people who earn a darn good amount of money but just can’t help but feel miserable inside. The reason it happens is that the thing you’re occupied with most of your time is not aligned with your core values, or in other words with what you find meaningful.

An important truth to consider is that the majority of the population doesn’t dream that way. Everyone’s frame of reference for success is set up differently. Having children who don’t end up in jail, or living without debt, maintaining the same job at the factory, humbly being part of the community, any of those could be determining factors of life success.

### No Talent, No Potential. PRACTICE!

However, in this writing, I’d like to address those who have a dream brewing inside but can’t seem to find the right recipe to cook the potential (bad word) they got. I’d like this collection of words and sentences to shed light on the collection of strengths, potential (again), vulnerabilities, dreams, inner voices, visions, abilities every one of you already possesses. Bear in mind, nobody is born good at anything, we become everything we practice.

Essentially, we're on a quest to find that which is most meaningful for us to engage in our daily life for long periods of time without being utterly bitter and regretful about - and pursue that.
