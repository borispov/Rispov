# Effortless Effort

What does *letting go* means?
A phrase voiced so frequently, yet carries all kinds of subjective meanings and misconceptions. If we'd play a little game of associations and write them down, how would such board look like?

*Meditation, freeing yourself from past traumas and experiences, anxieties, thoughts, emotions, expectations, etc..*

I'd like to offer a perspective for letting go as an attempt to step back from
your expectations to allow a process which you aren't prepared for, a process
that might yield unknown and unexpected results.

I'll present two examples taken from my daily work as a Mental Health
Services coordinator. First, I'll briefly describe the supervision part of my
job. I supervise my staff (which consists of mentors/counselors) in the
rehabilitation process of our clients who are mentally disabled in varying degress. During supervision we
typically discuss concrete matters concerning the individual's program as well
as more dynamic and cognitive parts to further facilitate the process and
provide a space for expansion and growth for the mentor. Often, we touch on abstract areas that
aren't directly related to any specific client and eventually draw relevant
connections. Such practice encourages broader level of thinking and abstractions
which allow for better understanding of clients, and people, in general.
Understanding other's point of view without identifying is the core of Empathy.

## First Case
Mr. Kapach is an excellent young mentor who works with Dennis(33) for 1.5 years
already. The two have built a professeional and meaningful relationship that
aids Dennis in his rehabilitative program. Dennis copes with OCD and Asperger's
and his main complaints for which he was referred to our services is mainly of a
social and interpersonal background. Dennis does not have any friendships or any
relationships except with his Mother and Grandmother. Dennis is technically
oriented, he's into electronics, gadgets and programming. In recent years, he's
been obssessing over his declining ability to concentrate and maintain focus,
for which he largely blames his medications.

A couple of months ago, the three of us met at my office to examine the current
program. The purpose of such meeting is reflect upon challenges, failures and
successes. Then we adjust or rebuild the program according to client's vision
and needs. With such outstanding collaboration on everybody's part, we had great
results, insofar I was even a bit proud with how I
conducted the seemingly fruitful meeting. A month later, Kapach shared how
nothing we discussed had worked and felt like we hadn't even had a meeting
together. That said, Kapach told that he spontaneously took a different route
which has worked wonders since.

He simply stopped pressuring Dennis to compulsively follow along the program, instead, he
handed the responsibility of their meetings to Dennis. Not knowing what'd
happen, genuinely allowing for whatever to happen. This has brought the most
desired yet unexpected result: Dennis began to take initiative and offer
various kinds of co-activites.

## Second Case
Mrs. Anna is an experienced and much appreciated mentor. In last supervisions,
she primarily shares her challenges working with Orna, her client. Orna is a highly
intelligent woman in her 40s, single, graphic designer, lives by herself with a
dog. Orna suffers from Bipolar disorder, emotionally unstable personality and
substance abuse. Orna generally doesn't feel too well, especially when
she mixes up substance abuse during her high/low episodes.

Lately, Orna has been projecting anxieties and frustrations onto Anna, often rendering
Anna exhausted and helpless. In their last encounter, Orna went into a rageful
stream of loud thoughts, and although not explicitly directed to Anna, Anna felt
an uncomfortable heaviness in her shoulders and stomach. Usually, Anna would
react in either comforting manner to soothe Orna, or contradictive to refocus
her back on the positives. This time, though, Anna sat and listened quietly
abstaining from any comment, which isn't her natural stance. In turn, Orna
quickly stopped her rant and shifted to speak about the wonderful parts of her
journey with Anna and in general. Anna had no insight as to what
might have contributed to Orna's sudden change of state.

## Interpretation. Kind of.
While we can draw all kinds of interpretations from each case, instead, I'd like to
address a common point from both cases. They both had invested significant
amounts of effort to reach a goal that was--supposedly--mutually agreed upon. Only to
witness the failure of their attempts. Then, in similar situations
they were most likely to repeat the same behaviors, they spontaneously let go of those efforts and
compulsions. This isn't giving up, this isn't an act of frustration or
resentment either. Instead, it's act of submission to the unknown. You admit
that you do not know the best course of action.

This is not a call for letting go of all active stances in the name of *letting
go*. Instead, this is an invitation to view *letting go* as an active
collaborative process, where you're taking a break from trying hard to obtain a
potentially the impossible.

Effort has its place where it's appropriate. You cannot impose what's
inappropriate, it won't fit. So, let go and witness how the most fit solution
manifests itself before your eyes, should you care enough to notice.

## If You Can't Beat Them, Let Them.
This is not about submitting to the whimsic nature of the other. Don't *join*
them. Stop trying to beat them. Then, they are most likely to stop fighting
back and join you.
