There are rituals and practices artists follow religiously to fuel their creative work. Writers use techniques like waking up in the morning and writing down whatever comes out from the subconscious mind as a way to induce creativity. With years of practice, people are so trained to be in this mode where creativity just flows effortlessly. Now, creativity manifests itself uniquely within each individual, based on various personality factors. It's also important to distinguish between artistry and creativity, as artistry is about fine works while creativity is about the creative process of finding connections, and solutions to problems.

Now, you may find it a bit difficult to initiate the creative process because you're probably not as trained in it. I would like to introduce a fun little method that most of you are capable of doing right now.

It requires no special means and is available for all of you. It's fun and it doesn't require 3 hours of nonstop writing or drawing or meditating, but it does require some effort on your side.

### Let's Start!

Here's a question to get you thinking:  
What happens to YOU when you visit new places?  
What happens to YOU when you learn something new?

Your brain lights up, the wheels begin to spin, and new connections are wired in your brain. Your brain is being creative. If you practice mindfulness in those moments, simply to become aware of what's happening, you'll open up to a potentially wide pool of possibilities, connections, ideas. It already happens with or without you, only now, you'll be conscious of it and take advantage.

Go Somewhere New! walk to a neighbourhood you never been to, drive to a village you never visited, walk by strangers, sit somewhere and contemplate.

Alternatively, learn something new that is interesting to you. Spin those wheels in your brain and maybe try writing about what you've learned and how does that relate to your world.

### Why Does That Happen?

Novelty sharpens our senses to gather and process new data. This process introduces learning and making new potential connections. This is a creative process!

What you need is awareness of what happens both externally and internally. Just notice that and see how you're transformed. Or at least, you might get an idea for a potential transformation.

### To Sum Up

1. Go Travel. Explore. Don't have to go far. Just take a walk in the streets of your town you never visited on foot before.
2. Be Aware.
