It may be unclear what sacrifice means in the context of change, although you might have an idea. We must take a glimpse at what change is before we examine how change and sacrifice are linked. Change is the alteration of current state by creation, modification or removal. Like a transaction, you part from funds in favor of receiving an object in exchange. Nothing guarantees a beneficial transaction. In economics, a beneficial transaction might depend on factors such as Return On Investment or Expected Value. There is utility in using the same metrics when contemplating a change, those terms evaluate whether the expected benefit from accomplishing the change will be worth the resources you’d have to sacrifice. Often, individuals don’t account for potential losses when going about change, instead they start off focusing on the benefits and experience--as a result--a boost in motivation that plays an important role in transitioning to the _exploration_ stage. Lack of awareness and denial of potential losses associated with commitment to a certain change can undermine the process as soon as motivation levels decrease. Hence, the need of addressing the sacrifices required from the individual has to be met, carefully, but methodically, by asking questions and peeling off layers of one’s inner onion.

A common paradox is rooted in the very reason one might even consider the change. Consider a case study, Michel is 25, he’s single, overweight, and desperately wants to lose weight. Michael’s major complaints are low self-esteem and difficulties with dating. He has tried many diets and programs and has never lost over 8 kg without gaining it all back. Hypothetically, when asked to rate the importance of this change to his life on a scale from 1 to 10, Michael picked 8. We can learn Michael values the change highly, and we’d be actively curious about the reason for this by asking questions — in a manner that’s polite but thorough. It’s not at all uncommon that people hold fantasies that once they achieve the change, _everything_ will be different, in a utopian sense. He might hold on to a fantasy that once he lost weight, he’d be hitting on all the beautiful girls he dares not to even talk to today. However, a viable proposition would be that his weight is actually a defense whose purpose is to avoid facing the deeper problem which is: _everything about dating._ See, if he succeeds, and gets to his optimal weight, then what? Will he then — magically—be able to talk to the girls he so desires? This is not a yes or no question. Instead, it’s the underlying anxiety that might have damaged each of his previous attempts. It’s not simple if you’re not aware of this, but once you this exercise, you can do it yourself.

However subtle they may be, every change has its sacrifices. In the example above, Michael’s reason for losing weight is gaining self-esteem because he’ll be good-looking and then he’d be able to engage in seeking a romantic relationship. So, losing weight equals engaging in a romantic relationship. In reality, losing weight can definitely improve aspects like attractiveness and, in return, confidence — but it doesn’t solve the problem of _dating_ merely by itself. Michael will then confront a deeper challenge and perhaps the one he’s really avoiding or worse — denying. Assume Michael lost weight, and despite that, has failed to meet his own expectations — what will he have to blame then, other than himself? He won’t have his weight and his bad-looks to blame, because he would have sacrificed that part. That’s threatening. Acknowledging such truth can be unsettling. Because then, Michael can’t blame his genetics, biology, bad behavior patterns for all unsuccessful attempts to lose weight. In psychology, it’s considered a self-destructive behavior pattern.

Here’s a small exercise: assume you’re Michael and re-read the case again. How would you react, if I told you that the underlying reason you can’t truly commit to the change, is because overweight is also your defense? Not every change has a sacrifice point as clearly laid out as in Michael’s case. If Michael was an actual patient of mine, it could’ve taken months—sometimes even years—to accept a realization like that. We tend to cover up our anxieties with rationalizations we can live with at least somewhat comfortably. Despite uncovering layers of unnecessary protections can be a painfully long process, it doesn’t mean that you should withhold any change in the meantime. It’s unnecessary to dig through the muds of your defenses in order to begin action toward change, since what’s hidden may be so cluttered that it would be counterproductive to do so. Instead, be vigilant throughout all the stages of change, pay attention to what weakens and slows you and examine that, don’t be naïve in your examinations. Ignorance will endlessly get you if you won’t be mindful about the sacrifices you’re not willing to make, a brand new diet won’t magically set you free of your excess weight, a fancy alarm clock won’t magically wake you up at 5 A.M consistently, a fresh new idea isn’t what’s going to make your dream start-up going if you failed to launch 1 project out of 99 attempts. The source for your answer is within.

Remember, sacrifice point exists in every change.
