Today I started a challenge.  
I decided to publish 100 Instagram photos that capture moments of happiness.  
I called it Under The Nose Challenge, with the hashtag #under\_the\_nose

Happiness is overrated and overlooked. It often lies right under our nose in its simplest of forms. It's overrated simply because of its unreliable nature. More on that at another time.

I, am a fairly pessimistic kind of guy, and yet, I think I have a fair share of happiness in my life. Though, it is not as appreciated as it is deserves to be. I anticipate the challenge will be fun at most times, but unsurprisingly it isn't my goal. What I look for is whether it'll carry an insightful impact on me. Precisely, I would like to monitor for potential changes in positive emotion. Would embracing happiness consciously, and celebrating publicly on my social media elicit any meaningful change?

I imagine it won't be easy to post consistently, let's see how it goes.

Remember, it's Under Our Nose.
