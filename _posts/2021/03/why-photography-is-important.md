Photography essentially has two primary functions: memory and [communication](https://www.icelandaurora.com/phototutorials/psychology/photography-basics-photography-as-communication/). In the past, we sent letters with photographs. Newspapers' photographs have an obvious purpose. Commercial photography's purpose is to _communicate_ a message to an audience. Over time, we've revolutionized the way we physically exchange photographs. It's absurd how accessible it is today. All we need is a smartphone, a means to connect ourselves to the rest of the world, and Voila! **Potentially** everyone can view your photograph.

_In quarantine, I'd send my wife a picture to describe non-verbally a funny or a frustrating situation I had to deal with. That's communication._

From a memory standpoint, in the past people photographed small individual and family heritage pictures to pass along the generations. When I was a child, we had lots of albums. We would review them together and that has helped me draw a connection between my Mom's narratives to actual faces. To this day photos serve as a point of reference in time. But perhaps, the emotional link they carry is the real excuse for piling up on more and more albums.

Yesterday, Facebook reminded me of a [picture I photographed](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMLCBQ4gGO6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) exactly two years ago. It evokes emotions and memories and I felt as happy as I was at the moment of taking the photo. My wife held Lian (our daughter) by the railing in front of the sea and as water splashes would hit their face Lian would get so ecstatic, it was absolutely fulfilling. So, the power of a photograph is immense. I used the photo as my 5th post in [Under The Nose](https://www.rispov.com/3649/under-the-nose-challenge/).

#### My Message To You

To conclude, let's answer the question: Why Is Photography Important?  
A single picture is a gateway to old memories. A photo may throw us back in time and give others a glimpse of who we were and understand us better.

Use your camera and do not forget the power of an excellent photograph.
