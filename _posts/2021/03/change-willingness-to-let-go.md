Change without the subject's willingness to pay the sacrifices isn't going to cut it. You'll find yourself in a loophole failing to make a change in certain aspects of your life for years, not realizing why. You must be conscious about sacrifices, in other words, the consequences associated with committing to a certain change.

Two years ago, I decided to wake up early in the mornings. I set up a goal. I set a strategy. I broke the strategy into micro-goals. I _planned_ thoroughly. And it worked. I would go out for a 25 minutes run, and alternatively, I'd walk my dog out instead. Then, I'd work on web development projects or study. It was so fun in the beginning, I was productive and I appreciated my alone time as an introvert, it felt like I have found my thing, _the-thing!_

But of course, I'm writing this to back up my first paragraph's claim, so what happened? It simply didn't last for a very _long_ time. I was heavily dependant on motivation which proved itself unreliable for the long-run (again). I wasn't _really_ willing to pay the price. What was the price?

Think about it, is there a change you've been wanting to make for decades? A change you're stalling about, or perhaps even attempted a couple of times but failed. Such changes are met with ambivalence inside of us, we have reasons **For** and **Against** that change, no matter how _good_ the change is. For example, it's clearly a good idea to stop your drug addiction, but it's not that simple, and it's not because it's physically addictive, no.

Drug addicts have reasons for continuing their usage of drugs. Otherwise, they wouldn't have started in the first place. Some drugs make you ecstatic and blissful. Some drugs numb your pain and alternate reality which might be just the reason to keep using.

Back to me. I wasn't really willing to let go of going to sleep late at night. I'm addicted to it, for years I have been. And so, over the course of a month, I stopped waking up early altogether. I couldn't realize why I couldn't keep at it, given how good it was for me. It took me a while to come up with the reason. It's pointless for me to keep trying to come up with better techniques and hacks for waking up early in the morning if I'm just not willing to _suffer_ to consequences.

On the contrary, also two years ago, I quit smoking. How? easy peasy. The hardest part was long before the quitting point. I had to have a dialogue with myself. What exactly I had to let go of? Why am I really smoking? Will I be able to drive without smoking? Will I be able to socialize without...etc. I think I was like that for about a month. Then, I had the flu and smoking was nearly impossible. At that point, I quit and it seemed so easy without taking to account the internal work that preceded it.

Some changes are made with such ease you don't even notice what happened. It's fine. But everyone has got something they struggle with and can't find the right angle to tackle it. What I suggest is before you approach a change with a strategy, with tricks and methods, with plans and schedules, take a step back. Check yourself, what are the _**inevitables**_ you're going to let go of? If you can't find any, you're not honest enough, try again.

How do you benefit from **NOT** doing this change?

The work you do here is crucial. You must become aware of the things that hold you back because chances are they're not going anywhere. You might have all the motivation in the world. As my supervisee has once said, "My Black Wolves are always lurking, if I ignore them, I get knocked out". As part of an exercise, she described how she wanted to start practicing Yoga for years, but failed every time. She felt that something always undermined it and she hasn't been able to actually do it. The black wolves are the hidden reasons that contribute to you not succeeding. Finding out what are your black wolves, or, what is your incentive to NOT commit to the change, is the key, to set yourself up for a successful journey.
