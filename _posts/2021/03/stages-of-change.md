In recent years, in the mental health field, we rely on the traditional circle of change, commonly known as _Stages of Change_ which contains originally 6 phases: 1) pre-contemplation: a stage of no thoughts or intent toward change; 2) contemplation: thoughts occur, one observes the possibility of obtaining a potential new state, ambivalence is present, back and forth; 3) preparation: inclination toward the change, ambivalence is still present, assessment of strategies, difficulties, challenges, the emergence of the plan; 4) action: the peak of all stages, the execution of the preparation stage, some individuals make public announcements to family members and friends about their change; 5) maintenance: the behavior is part of the individual integrated self, it’s sustained similarly to other behaviors, the challenge is to sustain the behavior over the long-term, preventing relapse; 6) relapse: embracement of the relapse is crucial in prevention of the next one, unfortunately, a relapse might also cease any progress and a person can fall back to the pre-contemplation stage, the beginning.

## Reduction Into Three Stages
For simplicity’s sake, I had reduced those six stages of change to three—most importantly, I modified their names and definitions: _contemplation, exploration, commitment_. I don’t detract from the importance of other stages, they’re important to comprehend. The pre-contemplation stage in some sense is outside the circle of change, it’s a stage you’re always in—in respect to every potential change you’re not engaged in. The utility of this stage is to identify a problem worth solving. Moment you find a problem to solve, you enter the _contemplation_ stage where you wonder about aspects like: can I do it; what will life look like if I do it for the next 5 years; what might be the short- and long-term benefits, and drawbacks/costs; what would be the most efficient way to tackle this?


Relapse is a vital stage where one can either drop out of the circle and start over in the future, hopefully with insights on how to do this better next time, or start right away with powerful experience and insights that can boost both motivation and competence. Though, the reality is not so simple and relapse can devastate without a proper guidance. Furthermore, people don’t naturally gather reinforcing insights, but are prone to errors in thinking and perception that lead to formation of false truths. The reason I removed this stage from my stages of changes is because I consider it part of _commitment_ stage. In the commitment stage, you address tough questions like relapse and slips; not all slips are relapse and the differentiation between those is fundamental in relapse-prevention.

Action stage is divided between _exploration_ and _commitment_ stages. Maintenance is left mainly in the _commitment_ stage. Active state plays a role in both stages, in exploration it’s the act of trial and error and figuring out the pattern that works best for you. Accounting for every single variable is virtually impossible—if not for the reason most variables are unknown, because—well, what do we know, really. I ascribed action in the _commitment_ stage to the act of showing up consistently, every single time, despite the temptation for deviating.

Dynamic motion from one stage to another, forward and backwards, is totally possible. It may be barely noticeable and subtle, but it's not uncommon. Think about someone who regularly attends gym three times a week. Then due to sudden minor changes in his life, his schedule and routine has been put to question and he reduced his workouts to two times a week and some weeks he misses one workout. It's entirely reasonable to argue that he had regressed from a commitment stage to an exploration stage. If he'd stop working out altogether but still questioning whether to keep practicing with a slightly modified schedule or cease the gym membership and take a break from fitness, he'd be in a contemplation stage.

## Proportion
It's possible to get discouraged by the mere fact that you had reduced your execution days from _x_ days to _x-1_ for example. Hence, knowing the stages of change, you'd be aware that you simply had moved one step backwards and that it is natural. Moreover, it can strengthen you further because a regression allows for _**reflection**_. In classical therapy regression is one of the key breakthrough components for an insightful process. Reflection creates space for introspection about the process and potentially about the way forward. Some people may decide to withhold their change during this reflection process and I say it's fine, I would strongly recommend to do so from an aware and conscious state of one's own process.
