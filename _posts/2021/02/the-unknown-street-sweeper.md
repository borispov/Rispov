This morning, as I was taking a walk with Astra (my goldie), I noticed a change in the view. The street sweeper was replaced, it wasn't the regular Russian, it was an African man. There was something about him that caught my attention.

He seemed to really make an effort as he cleaned the area. Then, he took a break and had breakfast. Slowly, he ate his sandwich as he enjoyed the beautiful weather, and generally, he seemed rather peaceful. To my eyes, it was a different experience altogether compared to the regular guy's resentful energy.

Full of curiosity, I began speculating about what his life might be like. Quickly, I grew curious about street sweepers in general. Who are they? What do I even know about them? What kind of men are they? I always see them, they're blended in the background, in the shadows.

I contemplated the possibility of approaching this name and spontaneously interviewing him, I then thought, what if I do that, interview street cleaners, and post their stories? It may, however, turn out to be just flat-out boring, but it may just be fascinating.

But, I wouldn't know, I got doubtful.
