Writing a book is an idea I've been flirting with for at least 6 years but never had neither the guts nor the maturity I believed is necessary for such a process. On the 7th of March, I decided to go for it, and writing a book became my new venture. However, it didn't come without a sacrifice, I knew perfectly well that my blog's consistency will suffer as a consequence. I wanted, although I hadn't planned for it (unfortunately so), to share excerpts from the book. Sadly, I didn't manage it correctly and only two ([one](https://www.rispov.com/3692/sacrifices/) and [two](https://www.rispov.com/3689/stages-of-change/)) posts were written ever since I started writing the book.

Also, at this point, the blog still hadn't been marketed or shared publicly for no reason other than my insecurities.

Choosing a topic for the book among the rich well of ideas that occur in my mind wasn't too hard at all. I had to pick a subject that:

1. I'm fairly educated about.
2. I had some professional experience with.
3. I find interesting.
4. I find meaningful for myself and others.

I knew that not meeting all of those could turn into an obstacle I might not be able to overcome, or that would set me on a different route altogether. If the subject were something I knew almost nothing about, I'd find myself researching and studying it from zero, hence, the primary task would turn out to be studying rather than writing, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's simply not what I was up to.

I chose to write about **change** with a simple goal: help people make the changes they want and need in their lives by providing information and systematic methods that can assist any individual to lead the change they want in themselves.

Aligned with my personal skillset and capabilities along with the goal I set, it was clear that I'm not going to write a big book on this, instead, I write a short, comprehensible, easy-to-follow e-book. In parallel, the plan is to write out an even shorter version in form of a simple handbook for a fast read or a reminder.

In any case, I hope I won't let the blog cool down too much in the foreseeable future and the posts will keep coming.
