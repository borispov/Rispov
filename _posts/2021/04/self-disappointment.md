How often do you feel you could've done better or worked harder? How often do you disappoint yourself?

Self-disappointment is simply a state of mind that is neither good nor bad. Often, caused when your actions are not aligned with your system of values or your ideal. You may experience guilt, shame, and embarrassment. 

You can use this as guidance, as a signal that you've taken a wrong turn, and you must recalculate your situation.

However, *taking the wrong turn* is an over-simplistic explanation. It could be that the action that has triggered the alert is part of an ancient, unhealthy, and fixated pattern. Self-disappointment may help draw your attention, serve as the first step into unfolding the thick masking layers.

Watch your tendency to over-identify with a negative narrative by creating sufficient mental distance between yourself, related events, thoughts, and emotions. Seek for the underlying source of every frustration, and observe that. Either it's a fatal misalignment of values and principles demanding resolution, or a subset of your values no longer serve you that you must get rid of.

The Key takeaway:
Self-disappointment can be a nasty demon or a great utility. Every painful and unpleasant experience carries a potential liberating lesson.
