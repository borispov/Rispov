Procrastination is quite a topic today.

Everybody has a reason & a cause for procrastinatio:
Fear, anxiety, perfectionism, stress, depression, social media, fear of failure, lack of motivation, etc. 
We even have talks that draw benefits of being a procrastinator.

## Danger
What I'd like to address is the danger of unconsciously nurturing avoidant patterns of behavior. That may happen as a result of procrastination, however, I don't like use the word procrastination professionally. That's probably because I chronic procrastinator, but really, is because the term doesn't mean a whole lot by itself, it require context. As stated, there are varying underlying causes.

Most dangerous causes are fear and anxiety. Fairly simple and logical. However, when anxiety takes over, it's everything but logical. It causes your mind to make ridiculous assumptions based on survival instincs and form generalizations to protect you from everything that might hurt you. For example, if you're afraid of a bear, you learn to be afraif of large furry creatures that aren't bears, too.

The thing is, if you experience unpleasant occurances, you might be naturally tempted to avoid the reoccurence of such events. Thing is, your mind works an extra mile as you begin to avoid things directly related to the occurence. Your mind is so sophisticated that gradually it begins signal you to avoid things that are indirectly related. You can see examples of this in teenagers that isolate themselves, gradually, but consistently.

### The Key
The key is **KISS** (Keep It Simple Stupid).  
Remember, if you feel an urge to *avoid*, you're probably going to pay more avoiding than by *confronting* that.
