Sometimes we undergo changes feeling as though the change was sudden and spontaenous, because we aren't able to trace the source of the process. We assume it just sort of happened naturally. We might even be tempted to conceptualize it prematurely and form annoying fate-like clich√©s.

## Initiation
Most likely, you've initiated the process long before it yielded any results. Suppose you quit smoking with seemingly no preliminary signs, no identified trigger and no preparatory process. You may not account all the discussions you were having with friends or colleagues on topics directly or indirectly associated with smoking, quitting, adopting healthier habits, etc. You could've initiated the surface upon which you've gradually--and secretly--built foundations for the correct moment.

Initiating means preparing basic ingridients, but even earlier than that, understanding and identifying what those basic ingridient. This is exactly what *"planting the seed"* means. You think about what the change might mean to you, imagine and visualize it and various forms and possibilities. Plant the seed.

In March 21, I started with Intermittent Fasting diet. It seemed sudden, because there was no conscious, active preparatory process, I wasn't involved in any kind of group activity, nor was I showing enthusiastic interest in diet plans. Naturally, it seemed like it came out of the blue for others, too. However, it wasn't like that at all.

On this particular Sunday, I "stumbled" upon a TED talk by [Cynthia Thurlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6Dkt7zyImk) at work. At the time, I was convinced *Intermittent Fasting* is for pure fanatics and is irrelevant for me personally. I figured I could at least educate myself intellectually about what exactly Intermitten Fasting is, and so I watched and unexpectedly I was hooked. It touched a boiling base within me that was initiated long time before I watched the TED talk.

## Take initiative

We often feel stuck when the energies we *waste* don't bring sensible results. While it's not entirely untrue, this is somewhat inaccurate. Think about significant endeavors and accomplishes you're proud of, how were they born? direct or indirect experiences, thoughts, ideas. What this means is that some of your biggest accomplishments have also started with some back and forth and perhaps even [ambivalence](https://rispov.com/_posts/2021/05/ambivalence/)

Some changes require more time than other changes to prepare a platform for a change to occur. It takes a whole year of physiological development before a baby can walk. For example, it must develop proper muscle strength and a sensory system as well as motors skills and more. The first initiative is to set yourself on a proper course of development and don't underestimate the significance of the [contemplation](fuck) phase.

## Wisdom

Engage consciously with the change you seek. Occupying yourself with a certain subject of interest means you're investing energies into it and orienting yourself in a certain way, isn't that *something*? It is, because that way you're more inclined to invest into that further. Playing with it consciously means embracing an attitude of willingness to bear and adjust to all kinds of [consequences](https://www.rispov.com/_posts/2021/03/sacrifices.md) that will emerge along your process, which takes great responsibiity to do so consciously. 

### Remember

Some changes transform you for good. 
- For some, it's a source of hope.
- For some, it's a source of terror.

Which is it for you?
