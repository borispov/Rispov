Recent curiosities led me to rediscover the meaning of meditation and face my arrogance--once again. Western societies consider meditation largely as an act of concentration on a certain object or concept while contemplating arising sensations, thoughts and emotions. Unfortunately, the definition of meditation is so vague that it leaves a vast room for imagination which leads to misunderstandings. As a result, myths are spreading rapidly leaving wrong impressions.

One common misconception is that meditation is merely a means of relaxation for times of immense stress. Another one is that meditation is an attempt to simply become an optimistic and happy, or perhaps an act of "emptying" your mind.

While all of those can sort of happen, they are by-products of being in a meditative state. [Sadhguru](https://isha.sadhguru.org/us/en/wisdom/article/nobody-can-do-meditation) has absolutely reshaped my understanding of meditation despite years of *practice* and false assumptions. Meditation--as we know it--is probably best explained by dhyana which is part of eight limbs of
[yoga](https://www.yogapedia.com/definition/7274/the-eight-limbs-of-yoga). It does not lessen the effectiveness nor the importance of meditation in my eyes, it simply serves to put things more precisely.

So, despite the fact that meditation is misconceptualized as means of relaxation, it's still a great way to deal with stress, nontheless. Meditation and yoga is also a great path for self exploration, genuine curiosity and longing.

Thanks to how widespread meditation is today, it has entered fields of science and is
being researched and incorporated into countless studies. As a Social Worker, I'm exposed to various theories, methods and techniques of therapeutic approaches and there isn't a shortage of interventions intergrating spiritual aspects like meditation. In fact, there are number of [mindfulness-based interventions](https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/mindfulness-based-interventions) including CBT [*Mindfulness*](https://beckinstitute.org/integrating-mindfulness-cbt/) where it shines. There are even [psychoanalysis and yoga](http://lynnsomerstein.com/psychoanalytic-benefits-of-hatha-yoga/) intergrations which I don't know much about, but it certainly is interesting.

## A Personal Story

By temperament, I'm more of a liberal than a conservative. In my 20s, you could tell I was left-leaning. I was very interested in spiritual concepts, meditation, ecology, etc. I considered myself a very eco-friendly, harmless and peaceful. 

As I matured, got married and became a father, I embraced conservative qualities and perspectives. My current circumstances and responsibilities do not allow the same lifestyle, nor do I seek it. Moreover, I believe that by embracing the meaningful responsibilities that are bound with having a family life, we can access further dimensions within our self. Certain tendencies and frequencies only manifest during certain events and situations. When I became a Father, I had to face the *not-so-peaceful* part of myself that I had pushed away for years. All kinds of old nasty patterns and tendencies that were kept shut *successfuly* till parenthood come up and challenge parents. Now, mastering your mind and body isn't the same task it was 10 years ago.

That is said out of an internal longing, not a complaint.
There is greater significance transcending intense authentic tendencies, than psuedo-transcendance of a false-self.
