Think about just how often do we feel we could've done better and should've worked harder. Does it take you to the pathways of self-loathe followed by a spree of sabotaging everything you _did_ create so far? Perhaps not, perhaps you're just disappointed and less motivated. That is normal, right? That is rationalization right there. Ever thought just how deep down are your patterns rooted? Uncovering the very first layer is the awareness of being let down by your self, it's just the tip of the iceberg, though.

Self-disappointment is a state of mind in which one feels guilt, embarrassment, or shame as a result of one's behavior that isn't aligned with his own system of values.

That in itself is a neutral state, neither bad or good. It's what one makes of it. Meaning, it can be used as a reflective tool that can aid you in understanding yourself better, or it can be a lethal destructive weapon used against yourself by yourself.

One of the first steps is becoming aware of being in such state. Then, the key is to avoid "over-identification" with the negative thoughts & narrative by creating enough mental distance which is required for further self-examination. Always, target the underlying source of frustration, as mentioned, it could misalignment with core values one holds. The mission isn't necessarily to fix a certain behavior, sometimes values and beliefs we hold from the past no longer serve us right or worse, harm us. We'd rather get rid of those nasty harmful deeply rooted demons than from innocent behaviors.

Everybody know at least a thing or two they _have_ to improve.

Just find the thing you tend to avoid, find hard to contain, blame others for, self-loath disproportionally, etc - and start your journey!
