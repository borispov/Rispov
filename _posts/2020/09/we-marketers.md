For years, marketing was a bad word in my view. Marketing was that hypomanic salesman who sold shady TV deal to my mother. A young energetic guy who couldn't care less but to sell a poor woman another loan and expand her debt. Spammy phone calls from big companies trying to lure you with yet another once in a lifetime deal. That was marketing and it was evil.

One day I was surfing around lurking for information regarding topics like dropshipping, e-commerce, and affiliate marketing, I stumbled upon a rather magical and vibrant persona. He almost got me into listing all my warehouse on eBay, and I don't even have a warehouse. I was hooked on the concept of "flipping". The magician's name is Gary Vaynerchuk a.k.a Gary Vee. After two days in a hypnotic state, I cooled down from the Gary spell. I took something with me, though. What seems to me to be the core, and that is: **get dirty**. Meaning, you should romanticize less, and do more.

And then. . . Naturally, I discovered [Seth](https://seth.blog).

_How I came across one of the most respectable individuals in marketing? I was so resentful of "marketing", I wouldn't believe I would ever admire a marketing guy._

## Enlightenment

First of all, Seth is the most introverted marketing guy I've ever listened to, which is in and of itself a very unusual thing for me. Second, Seth's take on "the calling" is something I pass around me religiously. It stands against the notion that you should find your passion and that everyone has this mystical-divine-special calling in life. Rather, it advocates for active exploration by _creating_ your passion.

Ever since I "met" Seth, my whole perspective around marketing has changed. I understood that fundamentally marketing is about bringing that which is meaningful out to the world. At least to the part of the world that would benefit it. Marketing is the means of transportation for ideas, cultures, ideologies, products, politics, etc. Anytime we engage in explaining our point of view with an expectation to spark genuine interest, we engage in marketing. We market the _thing_ we believe is significant and will have a significant impact on others. The idea then employs us as the messengers or marketers, which is partially why we're so disappointed when we _fail_ - we're not getting paid back for the work we so believe to be valuable.

## Core

At the core of the paradigm is the understanding that good _ideas_ are based on whether they are actually **helpful**. Most of our ideas sound useful mainly for _us_, while often other people don't need it. Fallin' in love with a bad idea puts us at risk of wasting lots of money and valuable time. However, good ideas are the result of _infinite iterations of **bad ideas**._ "First, ten", is a rule by Seth Godin. It means that if you've found ten people who trust and respect you/your product, it'll spread organically. And if they don't love it, you should keep iterating to the next idea.

That is my take.
