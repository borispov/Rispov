# Passion as treasure
How deep you have to delve inside your self. You know. You know that the consequence of successful discovery is a responsibility towards the realization of the discovered treasure. So naturally, there is anxiety, the separation from the state of ignorance. Maturing is painful indeed, but its reward is meaning, coherence, and alignment with your inner parts, inner judge, inner god.

### If discovery burdens, why would one dig? 
Ignorance is not without costs. You risk getting buried inside deep and ugly pits you have yourself created with your ignorance. Being buried together with all the unprocessed rooted evil you have neglected down there inside yourself, you risk manifesting this evil because you have no awareness of it, hence you don't get to control that.

On the other hand, digging deep down consciously, deliberately, and voluntarily, carries an enormous potential reward of becoming an improved version of yourself, and not in a cliche way.

## Spontaneity
I want to say something about spontaneity. It's absolutely overrated now. Especially within the New Age realm where people mindlessly practice mindfulness, yes, it is beyond ironic. The exaggerated emphasis on spontaneity is the exact opposite of being spontaneous. Don't get me wrong here, I'll make it clear. Spontaneity is a fundamental trait for our survival, we must be capable of spontaneous action to adapt to change. It's crucial, without it you might die. Beware though, it's not the end goal, but rather a means of survival in a sense.

Similarly, you have to strive for alignment with your values, principles, your passions, they construct what is meaningful enough for you to live up to. You can use your value system as an inner-guidance that will signal you when you go astray. For example, when you rescue a dog, you might experience that as a meaningful endeavor depending on how your value system is constructed. If rescuing dogs does not fill you a void for you, then you probably won't be willing to commit for more than a few years.

## How to find your calling

In my previous article, I discussed going broad vs going deep, which resonates with where I am today. I am writing this in part to facilitate my own process of discovering THAT which is worthwhile to focus on. Whenever I try to isolate ideas and focus on just **ONE**, I become over-protective of my other ideas. The sheer idea of neglecting the rest of my ideas is daunting. It's unproductive. A big injection of inspiration in the form of _Gary Vaynerchuk_ and _Seth Godin_ sets me right into an optimistic mindset of pursuing **something**. Vaynerchuk's take is you don't have to cut off other ideas, you should rather incorporate them together into the brand that you are. Godin's most important advice that trembled my soul, because I knew that, I never once have heard it articulated so well.

Seth claims that there is no special calling. He suggests you should do something recursively and examine your experience along with it. Resistance will arise if you're playing in the wrong field, according to **your values**. Resistance is not to be confused with fear, but nonetheless, the severeness or the degree to which the resistance manifests itself is dependant on various factors. For one, your personality type, which also influences your values system, is a good indicator of what it is that you might be attracted to. If you are an extroverted kind of guy, activities with lots of meetings and noise can suit you and may sound like a nightmare for a very introverted person.

## Self-Exploration

The key is **self-exploration**. You know yourself the best, right? Bullshit. What you know is a limited edition. There is a tremendous amount of you, that is unknown to you. I'll use myself as an example here. One of my interests is Web Development, I taught myself via the wonders of the internet. Pretty quickly I dropped the notion of working for a tech company because I consciously decided I'm not willing to pay the price. Rather, I kept studying and creating fun projects and sometimes even useful projects for my wife and myself. Today, I'm fiddling with an idea to work as a freelancer in the field and I am confident I can deliver a quality product to small clients. That being said, the actual **work** of building a product is a small fraction of the whole process. Whereas the rest of the process includes the majority of **the unknown** parts for _me_.

My job is to explore those unknown parts and **_then_** decide whether I'm up for it or not. In contrast to my premature decision to NOT work for a tech company, this is something I actually want to do.
