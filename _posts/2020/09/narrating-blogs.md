I have been wondering about stacking up a collection of top blog posts into an E-book and narrate it. Well, I'd have to hire a voice actor to do that task for me, my self-awareness would not allow otherwise. After reading a couple of blog posts of a well-known author named [Seth Godin](https://Seths.blog), I immediately pressed _"Seth's Top 100"_ to skim through the best of the best. I do not know if it is Seth's chosen 100 or based on the number of likes the post received. Skimming through the best content and then thoroughly going through specific bits is what I often do.

For this reason, I believe such initiative may benefit others like me. Plenty of people prefer listening over reading for various reasons. Time is a major one, since you can consume information while doing household chores, driving, walking, etc. Playback speed is a big one, you can set 1.5x speed and devour content! I've read somewhere that we process information better when we are listening, however, I'm not sure it's evidence based.

Personally, I prefer audio since reading a whole book with my ADD takes me at least twice the time. Some people with Attention-Deficit Disorders haven't read a book in their entire life for that particular reason. Nevertheless, I do find small blog-posts are easily digestible.

Moreover, the convenience is epic, you access everything using your smart devices. Firing up your favorite podcast series is ridiculously easy.

Back to the point. Applying that idea beyond Seth's top 100 posts is a completely different thing. I find most bloggers are but as terse and produce much more words per post. On the other hand, it does not disqualify it from being a viable thing to pursue.

What in opinion does disqualify the whole thing, is the simple and obvious fact, that the content isn't mine.

So, yeah...
