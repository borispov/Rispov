On this day Jewish people bless each other and wish A Happy New Year to everyone along with health and wealth blessings. As a Jew coming from the Soviet Union, I celebrate the beginning of a new year twice a year. Every year, my mother would assemble our antique Christmas tree that she inherited from her Father.

Growing up as a child, I could not grasp the notion of celebrating two separate holidays with the similar meanings. I used to prefer the New Year's Eve because we live by the damn calendar every day, it made sense. Today, I like both, for completely different reasons. It is a chance to retrospect and to refine your goals. An opportunity to look at your family members, and think about what would they like for their next year and how can you contribute to that.

Two holidays are not enough, this is a process everyone should incorporate in their daily life. That being said, it can be a great place to expand our perspective, "have I left something important out?", "did I consider my husband/wife?", "am I working on the things I want for my children?". and in the opposite direction, questions like "what must I let go of?", "am I clinging on something that is rotten?", "are there wars I should stop fighting?".

A couple of days ago in a meeting I arranged with my staff, I asked them if they would like to give their blessing to the staff. Everyone contributed quite comfortably, saying the most generic stuff. We are accustomed to generic blessings. Understandably, it is convenient, it does not require emotional engagement, nor does it require thinking. It's banal. Though I'm not suggesting it's useless, we need that to some extent. The danger is when it is the only way we communicate, on a convenient and banal level. If we are not capable of caring deeply enough to think and feel for our closed ones, to bless them in a truly meaningful manner, then we are perhaps not capable of doing so to ourselves.

Subsequently, I asked them to say what they wish for themselves. As they were required to connect to themselves and think, it became a bit more difficult. It might not evoke a deep immediate insightful revelation, but it encourages retrospective practice.

Therefore, I'd like to bless all of you, including myself.

I hope we all live a meaningful life, meaningful enough so that we will always, inevitably, find the strength we need to withstand any challenge and difficulty we might face. I wish you all well.
