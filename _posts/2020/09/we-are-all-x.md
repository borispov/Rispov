People are capable of all sorts of good and evil. The best of men make decisions with terrible consequences every day. Atrocities demonstrated in the 20th century served as evidence of the dark side of human nature. Regular and intelligent men and women were Nazis, many were prison guards in the Gulag camps. Those humans were not exceptions, they were mothers, fathers, children, students, neighbors, caretakers, they were you and me.

Any deviation from the norm is destined for judgment regardless of being right and wrong. The reason for that, partially, is that the unacceptable behavior resonates with you. Otherwise, you wouldn't care enough to judge it in the first place.

Joker the movie (2020) portrays that brilliantly. I've heard numerous opinions from bashing the movie for its violence to justifying Arthur's evil crimes. Not a single person described the movie as "boring". Good movies trigger intrapersonal dialogues and stories within us. Perhaps, if you're repulsive of Arthur's behavior to the extent of reacting aggressively when discussing it, you're unconsciously repulsive of your own aggression. In which case the judgment is actually targeted inwards.

The bottom line is acknowledgment is key. Everyone has the capacity for behaviors like Arthur's, hell, even for behaviors demonstrated by the Nazi prison guards. We must not assert that we are pure and good simply by being born Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, or whatever. Under certain bad circumstances, however unlikely you might think it is, it's highly probable you won't act the way you think you will.

  
How do you know you wouldn't be the oppressor?  
What if it's practiced by the majority around you?

We are capable of all those horrible, inhumane, immoral behaviors. It is within our capacity.

It is also within us to integrate it, make it part of our whole self, not a dismantled part. Master it. A person who is aware and is able to contain himself properly is more trustworthy and reliable. People who are not willing to face their own aggressive nature, are at risk of splitting their identity, painting the aggression as an external demon that occasionally takes them as a captive.

Whenever you exercise judging someone other than yourself, put yourself in their shoes. Raise the stakes and assume the circumstances are way worse. Contemplate the possibility of you acting worse. If you can't see yourself performing in a way that might disappoint you, then you're not true to yourself. In order to find empathy towards others, you must be willing to look into your darkness residing deep down in your roots.
