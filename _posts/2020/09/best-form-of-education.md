Fundamentally, education is a utility. A utility whose role is to provide the necessary knowledge and skills for human beings to thrive and flourish. Inadequately, we overrate compliance and it backfires in a way we don't know how to deal with. When a compliant toddler is one with the-drug in his hands, it's unlikely he'll be compliant _enough_ at school. The problem here is two-fold, parents' disciplinary responsibility, or lack thereof, and the educational system model. I'll touch on the latter.  
  
The reality is that the usage rates of screens went up drastically in the last decades. Various studies confirm that ADHD (among other disorders) is associated with overuse of screen-time. Children with predisposition to ADHD are way more likely to develop an early form of the disorder due to screen overuse. Moreover, there is a higher chance for developing an addiction.  

Problem arises when those kids face the demands of teachers who expect obedient pupils. Inside a classroom full with 30 kids, Ronnie is expected to sit still and listen without the-drug in his hands. Question is, has Ronnie took his Retalin this morning? What we don't know is that Ronnie thrives in a different environment, perhaps in a class he can participate _actively._  
  
Where I was born, USSR, compliance was a praised trait. To this day, my mother criticizes today's incompetent educational system as well as the utterly undisciplined generation who can't bear a tiny bit of frustration. While both true, irony shines when my mother is the first to comply to my daughter (toddler) most ridiculous whims.

### Solution?

Compliance is a necessary component for a functioning society, to some degree. Otherwise, we wouldn't survive. What I suggest is that compliance shouldn't be the goal of any system, especially not in education. We don't need kids to stack information in short term memory, and forgetting all about it after the exam. They don't care. We need young kids to engage, to take part, convince them they'll have a great time, all they gotta do is give a chance and open up.

Once, my teacher claimed Math is a symphony. She wasn't in love with Math, she was in love with teaching kids and inspiring them. We need more of those. I failed Math several times before she taught me, but surprisingly with her I wasn't worried as much, I was confident. And I did it. I got 90+ (out of 100) compared to previous 50 points.

We need more teachers believing in change, believing those young kids are potential "prophets".
