Fundamentally, education is a utility. A utility whose role is to provide the necessary knowledge, skills and experience for human beings to thrive and flourish. Unfortunately, in a school system that aspires to discipline children simply to produce compliant people, we can't flourish. This isn't to say discipline is wrong. It's an absolute necessity, however, it should not become the end-goal.

## Emma
Here's a little story about Emma, Math teacher. She was a jewish immigirant from the Sovient Union and portrayed some of the classic sterotypical characteristics of a Soviet person. She demanded high performance from her pupils and showed no mercy. She was fierce, sharp, and energetic, she possessed a passion that alluring. We used to laugh about how ridiculously she loves Mathematics, though, today I get it, it's not Math she was so passionate about. Her mission wasn't to inspire kids to fall in love with Mathematics, Physics and so on. Her mission was to inspire kids to *learn*.

The enthusiasm she expressed was almost burning, no present individual is left untouched by her fire. She made Math look easier, simpler, and fun. She encouraged the most struggling kids to bring their best, even if it's just for merely a passing grade, it's probably significantly better than whatever they previously scored.

Prior to studying with Emma, I gave up on Math after failing two major exams two years in a row. Convinced Math was for smarter kids, I believed I was quite dumb. Then they put me with Emma for just one month and within this month I *doubled* my scores (from approx ~46 to ~90). For that period of time with her, I was ignited, I was engaged.

Teachers like Emma should be inspiring young kids. Discipline and compliance are manifested as a by-product, a consequence, it was never Emma's goal. She was assertive, but she never yelled at a kid, she never belittled kids, she never expressed her impatience towards kids who struggled and were less intellectually capable. She would get angry at kids who wanted nothing else but to disturb the harmonious atmosphere that was naturally taking place.

## Emma Is Everywhere
See, Emma is a representation of something that exists everywhere. You can be Emma as well.
If what you do sparks a fire within you, be positive that the environment around you can sense that.
