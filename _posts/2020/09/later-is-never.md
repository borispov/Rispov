_Countless_.

I have failed to deliver up to my own standards for a countless times. The most common theme is, unsurprisingly: procrastination. A pair of heavily abused words as an excuse: _later_ and _tomorrow_. Execution gets further and further away, and before I know it, I'm off to the next project in que.

Sounds familiar? too familiar?

What if you could set reminders that target specific tasks you tend to avoid via E-mail. An angry shaming message that points at your self-destructive, miserable tendencies. A commanding mail, that demands action. Would that be a call for action or merely moment of amusement.

As I'm writing this, I'm trying to imagine what that would be like for me. What if I receive an email at 7a.m that goes like:

subject: "Did You Publish Your Blogpost, Freak?"

body: "It's 7 a.m, you should have done that by now. If you haven't, you better stop being sorry and quit making excuses. Hurry up!"

What would be cool is if you'd have to respond, otherwise he keeps nagging you every X hours. You can respond "Done", "Later", "I'm On It", "Cancel", "Tomorrow", "Freeze".

Interesting. It'd add a layer of interactivity with the user, which is either good or bad. Too much functionality can be a disturbance, on the other hand it might be a _helpful_ utility. Perhaps the first version should be clean and simple.

Question is, will I execute that, or will I delay and forget about it.
