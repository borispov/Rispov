Mike Tyson once said,  
"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth‚Äù Though Mike meant it literally, it's applicable psychologically, too.

Confrontation with unexpected results almost fits the analogy, except it is not precise enough. The way you deal with unexpected outcomes is not identical, it differs depending on various factors.

It is when outcomes don't fit your schema of possible failures, that you are punched fiercely. It shatters your perception of the world because your previous schemas don't fit the events, hence, they're outdated, which means they ought to **[change](https://www.rispov.com/3692/sacrifices/)**.

Some schema mismatches aren't as brutal and don't carry strong effect on the psyche. For example, if you believe that all CEO's do very little to earn very big and one day you discover the magnitude of the responsibility and impact of their decision making and so on, it probably won't crush your soul. On the other hand, if you worshipped your father growing up for his CEO skills and built your foundations based on your admiration of him, and then so it happens that he's accused of severe allegations proving his whole CEO practice is stained with blackmail, fraud and you name it. It would have an impactful effect on his perception of the world. It's only that his image of his father was hit, but the most basic trust mechanisms.

What can you do to avoid getting punched in the mouth, you may ask. Nothing. You get punched, you get over it, the next punch won't be as devastating, and even if it does, you'll be much more prepared and capable to confront it.

Now a bit more detailed approach. The effect of _failing_ so hard that your world collapses is **vital** for your developmental process as a human being. Fundamentally, your old perception does not fit the reality you have just experienced, it betrays you (to emphasize). Thus, your wired-connections (synapses) have to rewire. They'll reform according to your new perception of the world. The control you have over this is huge.

Perception. If you perceive a staggering event as harmful, and that you are incapable of overcoming it in the future, you're most likely to develop avoidant behavior towards it in the future. Nevertheless, it is entirely possible to set yourself on a different path, different mindset. Meaning, you are out to conquer it, for one, by adjusting necessary behaviors so that your next encounter with similar events, won't be as devastating.

In Hebrew there is a term "Growth from trauma", which means everyone has an opportunity to come out stronger from traumatic experiences. Not every punch in the mouth is traumatic by definition, but it may certainly shake you. That is how you learn and grow. Ask entrepreneurs, heck, ask parents, good parents.

So, have you got punched in the mouth, yet?
