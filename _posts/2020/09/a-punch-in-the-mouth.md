>Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth - Mike Tyson.


## The Phenomenon
Though Mike meant it literally, it's applicable psychologically, too.
When an event occurs and the actual outcome doesn't fit your schema of possible results, failures and successes, you get punched fiercely. Effectively, the punch shatters your outdated perceptions about the world, forcing them to **[change](https://www.rispov.com/_posts/2021/03/sacrifices)**.

Not every dissonance is equally brutal, nor does every dissonance bothers us strongly. 

## Illustration
Suppose you believe that all CEO's do very little to earn very big. When one day you discover the magnitude of the responsibility they carry and the impact of their decision making and so on, it may educate you but it probably won't crush your soul. Now, suppose you dream of becoming a good CEO just like your father whose been a role model for your whole life. At some point, you disocver your father is being charged with severe allegations of blackmail, fraud, and you name it. Which one of those scenarios more likely to punch you in the face? 

If the underlying components damaged are the fundamental structures of the way you perceive the world, you'll experience a serious earthquake that will force you to adjust. The discovery of staggering truth about one's father goes way beyond the actual allegation of fraud and blackmail. It undermines your trust in relationships, structures of society and basically the whole world, because that's what your relationship with your father represents.


What can you do to avoid getting punched in the mouth, you may ask. Nothing. You get punched, you get over it, the next punch won't be as devastating. The more you're punched, the be better prepared and capable to confront it.

## Dissect
The effect of _failing_ so hard that your world collapses is **vital** for your developmental process as a human being. What happens is that your old perception does not fit experienced reality. Your perception sort of *betrays* you. Thus, requiring you to rewire, reform a perception that fits and hopefully benefits you. The control you have over this is huge.

Perception. If you perceive an event as harmful, and you *feel* incapable of overcoming it in the future, you're most likely to develop [avoidant behavioral pattern](https://www.rispov.com/_posts/2021/07/grand-avoidance) towards it in the future. Helplessness in traumatic events increases likelihood of developing PTSD and depression. When a person goes through or witnesses a disturbing event, it's best to help that person regain control and self-efficacy. Furthermore, you get to choose and shape the way you experience and perceive various events.

## Exercise
Pick events that occur during the day and observe your perceptions, reactions, and emotions. Watch for sabotaging patterns, simply bringing non-judgemental awareness onto them will dissolve their hold on you. This is even before you work new healthier behaviors and perceptions.

In Hebrew there is a term "Post-traumatic growth" which suggests that people can rise higher than the harm of the traumas they've gone through. While it's not a novelty, I find it somewhat revelating. Not every punch in the mouth is traumatic by definition, but it can definitely fracture you. That is the way you learn and grow. Ask entrepreneurs, heck, ask parents, good parents.

So...  
Have you got punched in the mouth, yet?
