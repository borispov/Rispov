In my adult life, I often struggle with sticking to one project. I had abandoned lots of hobbies in favor of starting new ones. I enjoy the process of exploration of various activities and skills, but I suffer the consequence of not becoming an expert at none. To this day, I have to be very conscious of it, as I'm interested in too many things.

Broad versus narrow is not a binary decision, it depends on factors like your personality and how high you aim. Maintaining several big projects at once requires strict self-discipline and order. Keep in mind, diversifying means less time left for achieving mastery in any field.

_World-class portraiture photographer dedicates most of his photography-time to portraiture, NOT sports, or puppies. Chess Grandmasters invest thousands of hours honing chess game. If you want to be a one-of-a-kind web designer, you can't afford to spend time on activities that won't contribute to you in becoming a top-notch designer._

### Fast Learning

Growing up, the thought of missing out on other activities could tear me apart. I wanted to be good at everything but turned average at best. Fast learning, was both a gift and a curse (in a weird way). I could get started pretty fast in almost anyhing I touched, but when things got harder I'd usually skip to the next thing. I had been using this to my advantage in recent years by exploring new hobbies to find things that I'd enjoy. I discovered I love programming, photography, and writing.

I am a social worker by day, I work as a coordinator in important mental health service and I manage ~20 employees who give service to around 60 clients. Some of my colleagues do that over time, meaning, that is their sole project. **I can't do that**. I always find myself doing other stuff as well. For example, I programmed an app to assist my day job.

Eventually, I had to study for 4 years to achieve my license to practice as a Social Worker. I had to put in the hours to learn how to program at a practical level that is beyond making useless apps. When I was learning photography (that too, yeah) I was all-in. There weren't many concepts I wasn't familiar with, it was up to the point I had to decide whether I want to go further and build my way as a wedding photographer or not. I decided NOT to. Anyway, I acquired great skill and knowledge and I do not regret it.

### To Conclude

If you don't know what style suits you most, I can share two tips. First are _trial and error_. You have to be methodic, though, analyze results based on _productivity outcome_ and _sense of meaning_. Plan up to 2-3 projects you want to engage in, and roll with them. Be sharp and thorough. Plan out your projects carefully, so you don't set yourself up for failure.

The second tip is quite a clich√©, figure out who you are, but in a practical way. Some people are very strict and orderly and have a high work ethic, it's important to know that. Often, entrepreneurial folks tend to be very creative and risk-taking but have trouble organizing and managing. You have to know what you're good at and what is your weaker side. Perhaps working on 3 projects simultaneously while talking on the phone like Gary Vaynerchuk doesn't suit your personality, and you're more introverted and also would like to focus all your energy towards writing a book for the next 12 months or so.

Know Thyself. Good Luck
