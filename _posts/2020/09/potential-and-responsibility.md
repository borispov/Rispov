Questioning whether you're really valuable or effortlessly replaceable even by the next average, is actually quite common. Perhaps, also somewhat associated with the Imposter Syndrome. The notion that one's knowledge, experience, and skills are merely average, or worse, worthless, is brutally dangerous. Compulsive self-doubt is counter-productive and doesn't add any value, on the contrary, it undermines and potential one might have. Beating yourself up for not meeting your standards can be harsh, devastating, and also irresponsible. Self-criticism is good, but not if it renders you paralyzed, it's no good.

I believe everyone is inherently valuable, or rather potentially valuable to be precise. A notion that is a relief and a burden both at the same time, it's very perspective dependant. As much as one holds the potential for good, one carries the responsibility to actualize it over his lifespan. While responsibility helps set things in order, it may become a burden. Responsibility should be taken by choice whenever possible, though, respective to the ability one has to successfully withstand its demands. Nobody can bring any value and kindness to society without deliberately taking part of a burden upon himself and make good use of it.

We are born with raw potential. Unrealized, this potential is destined to rot. Brilliant inventions that serve the wrong people at the wrong time, render themselves useless.
