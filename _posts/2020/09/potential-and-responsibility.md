> We are born with raw potential. Our job is to let it flourish.

## Self-Criticism
Questioning one's own value and contemplating whether you're easily replaceable, is common enough to receive a dedicated name: Imposter Syndrome. While common, it can disrupt one's career and relationships. A healthy portion of self-criticism and self-monitoring can be of immense value, it's when it's overly-exercised that it becomes a problem. 

Self-criticism is good, but not if it renders you paralyzed, it's no good. Compulsive self-doubt is counter-productive and undermines the journey of realizing one's potential. Beating yourself up for not meeting your standards can be harsh, devastating, and also irresponsible.

## Potential
I believe that everyone is inherently valuable, or rather potentially valuable to be precise. A notion that is a relief and a burden both at the same time, perspective dependant. The potential we receive as birthright comes with a lifelong responsibility to realize this potential over our lifespan. This is perhaps also the cause of our brutal self-judgement, we carry an inner force that endlessly pushes us further than what we are. It's most effective when responsibility is taken consciously, with consideration of context, time, and one's ability to withstand the demands associated with certain responsibilities. It takes conscious involvement and engagement in order to bring genuine value to one's life and everything that surrounds one's life (family, community, society).

Take a piece of burden upon yourself and making flowers out if it.
