Practicing counterintuitive behavior pushes us out of our comfort zone and often causes unpleasant feelings, especially when we have to face the unknown.

In order to ensure our safety, we tend to avoid unnecessary confrontation with the unknown. We also have a need to maintain a consistent image of who we are and so we're less likely to behave differently. A person who's used to avoid conflict at all costs is less likely to express assertiveness. Nevertheless, exercising assertive behavior would require facing a range of different possible outcomes. Most people stick with the outcomes they are already familiar with.

What that means, is that I am likely to agree to a set of conditions in exchange for peaceful interaction, conditions that I'd otherwise reject. Put differently, I'd compromise in favor of feeling at ease in a conversation.

It definitely has been a common theme in my life.

This is especially true in agreeable people who tend to avoid confrontation and uncomfortable interactions, often at their own expense.

There are ways to get around this. For one, getting comfortable in rather unpleasant situations. Identifying sensations and feelings helps to desensitize and reduce the negative impact they carry on you, hence rendering you relatively calmer with each iteration.

Personally, it's quite common that a _Yes_ from me would resolve all the tension in a situation. My tendency is to play along and prevent any discomfort. That being said, I consciously practice setting boundaries, saying _No_, and aiming towards having a discussion instead of simply agreeing to something. It's tough to have a discussion if at the base/core you're not feeling confident. So at first, I had to force it, to fake it (if you will) to be just a little bit more okay with being uncomfortable.

## Discussion

The major part of forging a good deal is having a good discussion. It is within the conversation that middle ground is defined. The middle ground is a mutable variable that depends on factors like market, expectations, personalities, etc. Some of those factors are not within our control, but some are and we want to bring them up in a discussion to potentially set the middle ground in our favor.

Here's a little story. Me and my family are moving to a new place and we need transportation services. I had a recommendation of a guy, and he has offered a price of around 600$, to which I said: "I don't know how we're gonna afford that, we have lots of expenses and a tight budget", I paused, and then said "Is it unreasonable for you to do it for 350$?", he said "No, I can't do that", I wasn't surprised, but I wanted to make his price seem like a big overprice for me. "I understand", I said, "How can you help us?", I asked. "Hmm.. 530$", he said, which is a discount but still wasn't a price I could pay. "I really appreciate your offer. and I'd like to keep working with you in the future because I heard really good recommendations. It's important for me to work with trusted people like yourself. I'd like that we'll both be happy. 470$ is a price that sounds fair to me, how does that sound to you?". He said "OK".

That was the first time I went that far. My wife overheard the conversation and when I cut his price by half she whispered "WHAT THE \*\*\*\*?!". Neither of us is used to that kind of communication, in fact, as I mentioned above we avoid it at all costs. For me, it has opened doors of possibilities, for my wife though, it remains to be an uncomfortable situation. The other day we were shopping for a Refrigerator and we received an offer from the salesman. I tried to negotiate a better offer while sensing my wife's discomfort standing right next to me and convincing me we got a generous offer. She asked me to stop and told me next time she won't be coming with me because she doesn't like the back and forth feeling. She's got a point, I'm a newbie at this. I've never done that consciously, I'd innocently ask if we can get a discount and stop right there no matter the answer. Now, I am more persistent, trying tactics, and failing miserably.

The salesman creates a false middle-ground and then offers a slightly lower price forming an illusion that he sets you with a generous, exclusive discount. It works! We buy that every time. In the best-case scenario we compare prices online and find out the offer we got is barely competing with online stores. If the salesman offers all discounts in the first 2 minutes of interaction with you, then he does so with every potential customer. Meaning, it's not a discount, not really. It's the price, he just wants you to feel like you're getting a discount already, so you're less likely to ask for a better price because he's already "giving" you a nice price. There is almost always a better price. However, there is a chance you're talking to a sales-guy who hasn't the authority to offer "further" discounts, and he doesn't want to bother his boss and tries his best to persuade you even if it means losing the deal with you altogether.

Middle grounds exists in various areas in life like relationships, sales, work, goals, etc. We are taught not to question those and agree to the middle grounds that are decided for us. I'd like to believe it's in our power to question this status quo and offer negotiable grounds upon which we can build new foundations. Don't settle for a compromise because you're afraid or uncomfortable setting different rules, standards, and expectations.
