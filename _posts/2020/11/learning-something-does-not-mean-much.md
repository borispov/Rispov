Once behavior becomes second nature, a habit, it is far easier to maintain the behavior consistently. A common misconception, however, is that the habit sticks no matter what. It does not. It fades away. It becomes a memory, perhaps a little trophy to make you proud of how capable you once were. It's just enough so you can sleep tight. But it's not enough for your progressive individual growth, then it burns.

The challenge is to keep a habit "active" when circumstances are not in your favor, to say the least. When a major change occurs in one's life, it has the potential to disrupt one's inner structures that are responsible for certain behaviors. For example, moving to a new place requires tons of different tasks and chances are our routines are inevitably changed, disrupted. One might not be able to do everything he'd like to, the way he'd like to.

Recently, when I moved out, I couldn't think about blogging. I could blog from my phone, to be honest, but I was completely occupied with the whole thing that I simply didn't even think about it for 2 weeks. Now, Seth Godin blogs every single day. He'd probably blog even if he were in my shoes. Why didn't I? I have not _integrated_ this habit. I have blogged less than 20 posts, I think. You could argue I didn't make the decision Seth made when he started and you'd be right, but that's not the point.

It is easier _not_ to follow a routine you have not integrated yet.

A person who goes out for a run every day for 15 years, is much more likely to keep doing that than a person who runs every day for 1 year.

It does not take 15 years to form a habit.

It could be 21 days, a month, 3 months, whatever your favorite article is.

It takes a lot longer than that to integrate a behavior until it becomes YOU.

You can learn a new skill in 21 days. You can learn how to program in a month. You can learn French. You can learn something new every day. You can so many damn things. It just doesn't mean it becomes part of you, really.

The message of this post of myself is that I'd like to work harder on maintaining behaviors that I'd like to integrate and become part of my _established_ patterns. Everybody has something to work on.
