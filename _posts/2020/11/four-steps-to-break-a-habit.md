In order to break any habit, one has to become aware of the habit itself. The second step is to identify the underlying _need_ behind the habit. The third step is to measure the efficiency of the behavior in resolving the need. Often, you'll find out the need isn't relevant anymore. The final step is to find an alternative that is better and more efficient at resolving that need.

If you start exercising a new behavior that is also useful for you, it'll be much easier to let go of unnecessary and useless patterns that either merely waste your energy or even harm you directly or indirectly.

Remember, awareness is a great utility. It's a weapon, a sharp weapon.
