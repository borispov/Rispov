To break a habit, first, one has to become conscious of it. 
Then, one must identify the underlying _need_ the habit supposedly satisfies. 
The third step is to reevaluate the efficiency of the behavior in resolving the need. 
The final step is to find an alternative that is better and more efficient at resolving that need.

If the need is no longer relevant and the habit is still active, the mere awareness will cause the behavior to cease. Otherwise, there's probably something else you're missing that is fueling the life of the behavior. In which case you must dig deeper.

When you replace old inefficient habits with new healthy ones, the old ones naturally disappear.

As always, awareness is of great utility. 
It's a weapon, a sharp weapon.
