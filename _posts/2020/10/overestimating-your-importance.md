Sometimes I overestimate the importance of tasks I'm occupied with, to an extent it is dangerous. All people do when they're convinced the importance of their actions is high. The measurements are rarely based on objective researches, but rather on hunches, intuition, feelings. Experiences of revelation-like insights followed by obsessive work that leads nowhere.

A waste of time. If I'm obsessed with a specific idea, I can't do anything else. It's unproductive and worthless unless you're building the next Facebook, which you aren't, and I'm not either. Now, we ought to make mistakes to learn and grow, we have to make enough failing projects to make a successful one. I argue that failing requires execution, in the scenario I describe here it's the pre execution phase. It's idea-phase. Spending months on tweaking and perfecting your idea without actually moving forward is most likely a waste of time.

The main problem is the overprotection of our idea from criticism and invalidations. We tend to ignore and become defensive when someone doesn't like our idea. "They don't get it", "They're too .." and so on. Let's say I make an app dedicated to professional photographers, and I happen to know a bunch. I introduce the app and all of them say it's worthless. If I ignore the feedback and keep dedicating resources for that app, it's highly likely that it'll backfire on me.

A possible solution to this problem is to listen. Listen to someone close who knows you. I listen to my wife, she senses when I obsess over something that doesn't evolve into anything of value over time. She is usually on point. She is not a professional photographer but she knows me and she knows when I'm chasing fairy tales.

An idea is a potential project, a change, a product. It could be something personal, it could be business-related. It could be anything.
