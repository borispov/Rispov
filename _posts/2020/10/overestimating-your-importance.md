## The Best Idea, Just Not Perfect Yet
How often you obssess over ideas that lead nowhere? As in avoid executing and validating the idea, and instead, spend vast amounts of time just tweaking and tinkering with the idea.
Being so busy with an idea that it drains all your focus and energies, but you're convinced that it's the most important project. Of course, your convictions are totally solid. They're based on your feelings, intuitions, and breakthrough-like experiences. You can't do anything else efficiently, you've invested a hundred percent of your energies into it. You fell in love.

A waste of time.

## Distinctions
We ought to make mistakes to learn and grow. We must fail enough projects to make a successful one. However, to fail, we must execute.
I argue that failing requires execution, in the scenario I describe here it's the pre execution phase. It's idea-phase. Spending months on tweaking and perfecting your idea without actually moving forward is most likely a waste of time.

The main problem is the overprotection of our idea from criticism and invalidations. We tend to ignore and become defensive when someone doesn't like our idea. "They don't get it", "They're too .." and so on. Let's say I make an app dedicated to professional photographers, and I happen to know a bunch. I introduce the app and all of them say it's worthless. If I ignore the feedback and keep dedicating resources for that app, it's highly likely that it'll backfire on me.

A possible solution to this problem is to listen. Listen to someone close who knows you. I listen to my wife, she senses when I obsess over something that doesn't evolve into anything of value over time. She is usually on point. She is not a professional photographer but she knows me and she knows when I'm chasing fairy tales.

An idea is a potential project, a change, a product. It could be something personal, it could be business-related. It could be anything.
