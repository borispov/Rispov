This week, a colleague of mine shared a little story that has brought an interesting thought. A fluorescent tube has broken and he attempted to fix it. Little did he know how it'd collapse and break into millions of tiny little glass pieces shattered all over his floor and he began putting the pieces back together.

It was when he was about to clean it up that it got him thinking.

"What if you just can't get it all back together?",  
"What if your soul is shattered into gazillion pieces and you are just unable to get it back to whole again"

He wrote a little poem about how he now understands how difficult it is to put the pieces back together. He also stated that until this day, there may be some uncleaned pieces lying somewhere.

We work in the mental health field and quite naturally we think of our clients, how some of them are unable to do so. Some for just a brief period in their life, but some for a lifetime.

I only had one thing to add to my friend Menachem's story. The mere fact he has moved on despite the probable fact that he hasn't done cleaning the mess. When a change occurs, especially due to a crisis, we are required to adapt. Had we all chose not to, we would cease to exist. When we refuse to adapt, we get stuck. For some, the getting stuck part is pathological, to the extent, it renders them unfunctional. Others may be able to keep functioning but parts inside are potentially shut down, which is no good either.

Nevertheless, obsessing over putting the pieces back together is a counter-productive and potentially a very dangerous path. Moving on is often the portal for growth as well as the only means to shine a light of meaning on the losses/pieces we had left behind.
