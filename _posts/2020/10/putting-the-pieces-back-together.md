This week, a colleague of mine shared a little story that has brought an interesting thought. A fluorescent tube has broken and he attempted to fix it. Little did he know how it'd collapse and break into millions of tiny little glass pieces shattered all over his floor and he began putting the pieces back together.

As he was about to clean it all up, he got mindful.

## Insight
"What if you just can't get it all back together?",  
"What if your soul is shattered into gazillion pieces and you are just unable to get it back to one whole again"

He wrote a little poem about how he now understands how difficult it is to put the pieces back together. He mentioned that until this day, there may be some broken pieces lying in his kitchen, pieces he was unable to reach and gather.

Working in the Mental Health field, naturally, we associate such incidents and potential insights with our clients. How some of our clients are simply unable to recollect the shattered parts of their experiences, the puzzled parts of their personalities, some temporarily, but some for a lifetime.

## Adaptation To Crisis
I only had one thing to add to my friend Menachem's story. The mere fact he has *moved on* despite the remaining shattered glass somewhere. 

When crisis occurs, we are ought to adapt. Had we all chose not to, we would cease to exist. When we refuse to adapt, we get stuck. While we can priviledge some being-stuck time, we cannot remain in such a state for too long.

You can get so entangled in misery it gets pathological, insofar it renders you unfunctional.

Obsessing over putting the pieces back together is a form of stuckness. Moving on may possibly seem counter-intuitive but is often the portal for growth as well as the only means to shine a light of meaning on the losses/pieces we had left behind.

Thank you, Menachem.
