Never before have I been so possessed by an internal drive. Not characterized by primal needs, but rather by abstract archetypal chaos which symbolizes change. A change can manifest itself in multiple variations and each one encapsulates a whole different world inside of it. One does not go unchanged through a change.

Often, the "message" isn't brought up to consciousness clearly, it's disguised, encrypted. Some may experience dissatisfaction with a particular area in their life, or with life in general that leads to thinking/wanting about change, other experience so much havoc and mayhem in their life that a change is unavoidable, while others become bitter and resentful when their whole being is set up for a change but they are simply not willing to let go of their current situation. When that moment comes, one has some figuring out to do. A synonymous word for the kind of figuring out that is suitable for this mission is _exploration_. So, I have set myself up for exploration.

Eight years ago I made a decision to become a Social Worker. It wasn't an easy one back then as I was quite confident I won't be able to put up with the educational level and demands. In other words, I thought I was a failure. I barely finished high school and figured that I am not suited for higher education. It took me approximately two years to overcome my fears and sign up for the preparatory course despite my anxieties. One month before the first semester, I had traveled to India with a friend which has helped me as I gained a fair share of confidence by traveling to a country with a completely different culture.

Right there, a change was brewing inside, I didn't what that was, but I knew it was necessary.

Upon graduation, I remember a realization hit me and I thought "I had done it". The funniest part to me was that it wasn't as hard as I imagined it would be. As a matter of a fact, I didn't struggle as much as other students did, but I also wasn't as brilliant as some were. Those 4 years were the greatest lesson ever in my entire life because I knew I can.

Today, the very thing that I had learned is the same thing that causes the current storm inside of me. I know I can, therefore I _have to_. I owe it to myself and to my family. What is it? I still don't know. My intent is to figure it out, and by that, I mean... _exploration._ Recently, my wife has been going crazy from my never-ending rants and thoughts about 1,000 different routes I'm thinking about. The feedback I get from my wife is very valuable to me, she sees through my nonsensical thoughts and pierces them painfully, sometimes by actively ignoring me (it works!).

But, sharing my wife is not really exploration. It's the most basic form of validating my concepts, after that, I still have the exploration to do. Perhaps execution fits perfectly in this scenario as some concepts need to be executed and the learning that comes afterward is the exploration. Becoming a Social Worker is quite an expensive investment for exploration, I invested 4 years to become one and then had to work as on, just to find out if that's really for me or not.

So, a change is again brewing inside of me. I still don't know what that is. I'm trying various directions, **one at a time.** It may or may not involve Social Work in it.
