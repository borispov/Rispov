# New Age Spontaneity
New age movements celebrate spontaneity and sometimes it is viewed as an essential attribute for attaining enlightenment. Many claim enlightenment occurs spontaneously, not something to be actively in pursuit of, or actively seeking. Instead, it's the process of letting go of the inner conflict that fuels the pursuit in the first place.

So beautiful. I am calmed just by writing and reading it to myself. However, it's crucial to dissect and differentiate the meaning of the terminology.

Hindu language contains such a rich vocabulary that is able to distinct between numerous kinds of intellect, states of being and experience with clarity and precision. Whereas in English, we have words that mean 1,000 different things. What does spontaneity actually means in the context of spirituality and enlightenment, and how the concept of _"letting go of"_ is related to it if at all.

## Behold Dangers
Spontaneity, in the context of spirituality, is often misinterpreted as encouragement for indecisiveness. A belief that what needs to happen will happen regardless of one's actions, otherwise known as the "Let the universe take care of you" mantra. I'll radicalize even further by claiming not only the premise that such state of being is not harmful is false, but that is actually dangerous.
Remember, for the past hundreds of years we have been training people to comply and fit in with the new industrial era. Early on, in school, we are taught that hard work will get us an A grade. Now, we are taught to be spontaneous, to let the universe take care of us. For others, "universe" is replaced by "system". Let the system take care of you. Do not mistakenly perceive spontaneity as indecisiveness and a passive state of being.

The other danger is the illusion of a harmless being. Living spontaneously and letting life guide you is irresponsible when in fact you are postponing calls, meetings, not taking decisions, etc. If you do not live up to your own potential, you are potentially useless, hence living spontaneously is nothing but merely an excuse. The harm lies in those details.

If you're particularly good at something,  
AND you can give it to other people,  
AND other people will benefit from it in a way that is meaningful,  
AND you can improve your family's status quite significantly,  
NOT taking the initiative is harmful.

## In Defense Of Spontaneity

Each individual has a multi-layered inner space inside themselves. You'd be overwhelmed by the magnitude of the complexity inside you. There is chaos, and there is order. The play between them is constant and everlasting. Spontaneity  
is a manifestation of that play, and quite an essential play, indeed. It has nothing to do with the naive belief that the universe will guide, and all you have to do is play. It's a play that breaks the strictness of order in one's intrapersonal realm and welcomes the chaos in for a play. A play that carries an opportunity for growth as well as a danger for one's being.

Spontaneity's definition is the state of being when you act naturally, often associated with children's behavior. I would add that it's also the ability to adapt to unexpected circumstances. The ability to adapt is of survival quality, not one entitled solely to enlightenment.

Now, a little question,
Can you be consciously spontaenous?
