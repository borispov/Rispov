Despite my initial plan to focus a big chunk of this blog on parenting, I rarely write about it. Quite frankly, I think about it a lot, and I mean a **lot**. Being a parent and not dedicating a huge deal of thought about the fact, does not seem possible to me. Though, I often direct my inner dialogue in a pragmatic manner in an attempt to solve a problem. The complexity of the process and the eventual outcome depends on the magnitude of the problem. When things get really rough, I might find myself unproductively sinking myself in my own bitterness and resentment towards myself of how much of a failing dad I am.

My goal is to highlight the importance of discovering the source of the problem. See, it's hard to weigh problem's magnitude, as a seemingly simple everday _little_ problem may be a disguise of a deeper underlying problem. Most of us carry on we our daily life paying little to no attention to our established patterns and behaviors. Only when they interfer with something that causes problems, do we become aware. I'll share a story my lecturer told once.

When she was a young girl, she hated how her mother would tie her sandwich bags in a way that would bring her unnecessary attention at school. Later on when she became a mother herself, she noticed one day that she ties the sandwich bags for her children the same way her mother did. Despite remembering she hated it.

Not harmful. Not important. Correct. However...

Think about all the bad behaviors you might have inherited from your parents when you were a child, despite not loving it or perhaps even loathing it. Sometimes, merely stating "I'll never become my Mother/Father" is a statement that only project how hurt/angry/resentful you are towards them, even partially. Other than that, it carries no guarantee whatsoever about the kind of actions and behavior you'll actually practice as a parent.

It is important to discover what kind of child you were.

What kind of parenting did you experience from your Mother and Father. Think about how it shapes you as a parent. It's a process, it's not something you quickly **just** understand. Rather, it's an ongoing process of discovery. For some people, I'd advice to seek therapy to conduct this properly, simple because such inner 'investigations' are quite difficult on your own. A therapist will help you see through the forests you've gathered along the way. Growing up fatherless doesn't mean you cannot become a good father, it means it has had an impact on you.

A child learns most things about the world through his parents. Through their relationship between themselves, and through his relationship with them. A child that sees how his Father expresses aggression in a particularly violent way, is just a bit more likely to "inherit" that pattern of behavior. Now, if a Father was abusive, it doesn't mean 100% the child will be an abusive Father, on the contrary, most do not become abusive. Nevertheless, the child did not learn a healthy way to _integrate_ his aggression, and while he may not become abusive, he may possibly be struggling with that. You probably have heard the term passive-aggressive. It's one of the ugliest forms of aggression. You don't want that.

I'll end with a short self disclosure.

18 months old, me and my Mother immigrated from USSR to Israel and my Father stayed in USSR. I grew up fatherless. Not until recently, I had realized the implications and consequences of my history on my psyche. Moreover, on my parenthood, as I became a father. I had not experienced a father in my life, hence I did not learn how a father behaves in a family. Seeing other fathers does not properly count, because you don't really get to know other people close and intimately enough to establish necessary forms of role models, etc. The meaning of it is that at the very least, you have to become aware. Be aware of different patterns and behaviors.

Challenge yourself.

Why you do what you do?

Why you insist on certain principles, really why? because your mother did? or because you really believe so yourself?

Why you're angry in certain circumstances? Are you sure it's the most sensible response? If not, why were you **really** angry? Investigate.

Why you do not allow your child to some activity when most other people you know, do not object to such behaviors? They don't know better? Maybe, but maybe you're too ignorant to prove yourself wrong?
