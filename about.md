Rispov is an intermediator between my inner sanctuary and the external. This blog is an attempt to formulate and structurize that which occupies my mind and has perceived value in my eyes. The goal is to leave footprints for my future selves, future versions of my self to go back and revisit and ponder about what's evoloved and whether some aspects are worth be re-examined.

I have always found tremendous value in retrospection, much before I got exposed to various psychological models and theories. And this blog is in the same style, in the sense its purpose is to serve a framework of retrospective utility, as well as an organizing, formulating endeavor.

I write about what interests, concerns, fascinates, thrills, and compells me. I attempt to avoid touching upon subject I carry little to no knowledge nor experience with, or do so with cautionry.
