# You arrived! It's Rispov.

This blog is the intermediator for my personal thought sanctuary/factory. I consistently post on inconsistent schedule. Where thinking is confronted does not imply great absolute thinking, but rather relatively to my self's cognitive capacity and limitation.

I write about what interests, concerns, fascinates, thrills, and compells me. I attempt to avoid touching upon subject I carry little to no knowledge nor experience with, or do so with cautionry.

My name is Boris Povolotsky. Rispov is a rather lousy attempt to join three first and last letters of my first and last name, respectively. So..
